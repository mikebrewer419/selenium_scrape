2021,42,Influence of plants used in agricultural diversification on the nematode Heterorhabditis amazonensis,"In an agricultural system, to increase natural biological control, plants that attract natural enemies can be grown alongside the main crop. However, the effects of these plants on entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), important agents for controlling soil pests, and the action of their conservation are unknown. To assess the impact of these plants on EPNs, two experiments were carried out in a greenhouse. The first measured the effect of Crotalaria spectabilis, Crotalaria breviflora, and Tagetes erecta on the persistence and infectivity of Heterorhabditis amazonensis isolate RSC 5 for 27 days, compared to a control treatment without plants. The second trial evaluated the effect of C. breviflora and T. erecta on the displacement of the nematode. Additionally, the influence of predator Calosoma granulatum in this system was evaluated. The plants did not influence nematode behaviour in terms of persistence, infectivity, or displacement. However, C. spectabilis allowed the most significant persistence of nematodes in the substrate for a short time, and T. erecta caused the fastest suppression of the initial population of infectives juvenile. In the second experiment, neither the predator nor the plants affected the nematode's ability to move in the soil within 5 days. These results show that prior knowledge in agricultural diversification can help to control pests by inundative application of EPNs.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42051/30351,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Weed phytosociology in diversified soybean production systems,"The knowledge of the impacts of the management practices used in each agricultural production system on the ecological interactions between commercial crops and weed populations can assist in the development of specific and sustainable integrated management strategies. This study aimed to assess weed communities in soybean in succession to second-crop corn and production systems with crop diversification in Northern Paraná State. The study was conducted during three agricultural years (2014/2017). Six treatments were setup: 1 –corn/soybean, corn/soybean, and corn/soybean), 2 – white oat/soybean, rye/corn, and wheat/soybean, 3 –oat + rye/soybean, oat + radish/corn, and congo grass/soybean, 4 – canola/corn, crambe/corn, and safflower/soybean, 5 –buckwheat/ radish/corn, bean/soybean, and buckwheat/oat/soybean, and 6 –wheat/corn + congo grass, canola/corn, and bean/soybean. The relative importance value index of each weed species and the soil cover (soil, straw, and weeds) were assessed. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with four replications of 300 m2 (20 × 15 m). The production systems white oat/soybean, rye/corn, and wheat/soybean; buckwheat/radish/corn, bean/soybean, buckwheat/oat/soybean; and wheat/corn+congo grass, canola/corn, bean/soybean had a suppressive effect on the species Commelina benghalensis. Euphorbia heterophylla and Digitaria horizontalis were the species most adapted to the assessed production systems. Seeds remaining from crambe and radish cultivations became volunteer plants in subsequent cultivations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42182/30404,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Wheat yield and seed physiological quality as influenced by seed vigor, nitrogen fertilization and edaphoclimatic conditions","Wheat is one of the most important cereals grown in the world, and in Brazil, increasing national production is still a challenge. Nitrogen (N) supply can favor grain yield and the physiological quality of wheat seeds. However, the definition of adequate N rate and fertilization timing must consider genotype, cultivation environment, and initial seed vigor level. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of initial seed vigor and the combinations of rates and timings of N application on grain yield and seed physiological quality of wheat cultivars under different edaphoclimatic conditions. The experiment was carried out in Londrina and Ponta Grossa, state of Paraná, in a randomized block design in a 2 × 2 × 7 factorial scheme, with four replicates. Treatments consisted of two seed vigor levels (vigorous and non-vigorous seeds), two wheat cultivars (BRS Gralha-Azul and BRS Sabiá) and seven combinations of fertilization timings and N rates (kg ha-1) (control - 0N; 20 N at sowing and 60 N at tillering; 40 N at sowing; 80 N at sowing; 40 N at sowing and 40 N at tillering; 40N at tillering; 80 N at tillering). Number of emerged seedlings, vegetation index, shoot dry matter, number of fertile spikes m-2 and grain yield were evaluated. Additionally, the physiological potential of seeds produced in Londrina was evaluated by the testes of first count, germination, seedling emergence in sand and emergence speed index. The climatic conditions during the experiment, in both cultivation environments, were similar to average historical records, with some periods of water deficit. The highest grain yield was obtained with the BRS Gralha-Azul in Londrina, and with BRS Sabiá in Ponta Grossa. The use of vigorous seeds favored the stand establishment and the response of plants to N fertilization. The treatments 40N + 40N, and 40N + 0N favored the majority of evaluated variables. Both cultivars showed potential for the production of high physiological potential seeds in Londrina environment. Inadequate N supply impairs wheat grain yield and seed production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42741/30353,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Geostatistical modeling of “lethal coconut palm crown atrophy”, a new disease in the State of Pará","'Lethal Coconut Palm Crown Atrophy' (LCCA) is a rapidly spreading disease in Brazil, capable of quickly killing coconut trees and threatening the commercial exploration of this plant. The objective of this work was to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of LCCA in green dwarf coconut commercial plantation areas, located the municipality of Santa Izabel, mesoregion of Northeastern Pará, Brazil. Surveys were carried out at monthly intervals between January 2014 and December 2018, checking for plants with LCCA-characteristic symptoms. Geostatistics was applied to perform spatial-temporal disease estimates based on semivariogram modeling and preparation of ordinary kriging maps. These spatial estimates are conducted through interpolations that characterize data variability in the area. The spherical model yielded the best fit to the spatial distribution of the disease, as it presented the best coefficient of determination (R²), with the range varying between 14m and 45m. The Spatial Dependence Index (SDI) was moderate in the evaluations carried out between 2014 and 2017 (in the 0.26-0.64 range), but not in 2018, when it was strong (0.23). The values of the clustering intensity of LCCA-symptomatic plants were estimated in non-sampled points. The spherical fit model of the data indicates an aggregated distribution pattern, shown by aggregation patches in the plantation, graded by values of dissemination intensity. The kriging maps allowed the observation that the disease expands between plants in the same line, suggesting the possibility of the presence of a short-range vector.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42892/30354,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Development of mycorrhizal soybean grown in copper-contaminated soil,"High concentrations of copper in the soil are toxic to the development of plants and microorganisms. The aim of this study was to select arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi efficient for the development and yield of soybeangrown in copper-contaminated soil. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with a 7 × 4 factorial arrangement corresponding to seven rates of copper (0, 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 mg kg-1 of soil) and four inocula (uninoculated control and three mycorrhizal fungi, namely, Acaulospora colombiana, Dentiscutata heterogama and Rhizophagus clarus), in seven replicates. Shoot height; collar diameter; number of grains per plant; shoot and root-system dry mass; leaf area; specific root surface; copper content and accumulation in the shoots, roots, and grain; chlorophyll parameters; and mycorrhizal colonization percentage were evaluated. Inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Acaulospora colombiana, Dentiscutata heterogama and Rhizophagus clarus increases the phenological and physiological parameters of soybean and its yield when grown in soil contaminated with up to 480 mg kg-1 of copper applied to the soil. The Rhizophagus clarus isolate provides greater development and yield in soybean grown in soil contaminated with up to 480 mg kg-1 of copper applied to the soil, as compared with the other isolates.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43526/30355,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Vigor and alpha-amylase activity in common bean seeds under salt stress conditions,"Seeds with high vigor have greater capacity for hydrolysis and mobilization of stored reserves, which results in the formation of vigorous seedlings, and this behavior is observed under abiotic stress conditions. This study proposes to investigate the relationship of the enzyme alpha-amylase in lots of common-bean seeds with contrasting vigor, when subjected to the absence and presence of salt stress, aiming to identify the relationship of this enzyme with the vigor of the seed lot under these conditions. Seven common-bean cultivars were used. Physiological quality was determined by germination, vigor index and seedling length. The mobilization of reserves was evaluated under absence and presence of salt stress simulated with a NaCl solution with a concentration of 50 mmol L-1. The analyzed variables regarding reserve mobilization were reserve reduction, reserve reduction rate, seedling dry weight, reserve mobilization rate, starch, starch reduction rate and alpha-amylase activity. Results showed that the stress condition negatively affected all the evaluated variables; however, the cultivars classified as having greater vigor showed better physiological performance under stress. Salt stress in common-bean seeds affects seedling performance and reduces alpha-amylase activity during germination, and high-vigor seed lots exhibited higher enzyme activity in the no-stress condition.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43656/30412,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Energy balance and efficiency in crop rotation systems,"The production system model that has been adopted in most Brazilian regions, the soybean/second corn crop succession, has led to problems in water and soil conservation and favorable conditions for diseases, pests, and weeds in the agricultural system and, consequently, increasing its energy use. Crop rotation is an alternative to this production model, directly interfering with the problematic aspects of the crop succession system and, consequently, its energy balance. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the crop rotation system with the best energy balance and efficiency. The data on the quantity of inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and fuel), labor, and grain yield used in the study were collected from a crop rotation experiment conducted at the experimental station of the Rural Development Institute of Paraná - IAPAR-EMATER, Londrina, PR, Brazil, from 2014 to 2020. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks, with six treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of T1 (second corn crop/soybean), T2 (white oat/soybean, triticale/corn, and wheat/soybean), T3 (rye + black oat/soybean, black oat + fodder radish/corn, and congo grass/soybean), T4 (canola/corn, crambe/corn; canola/soybean); T5 (buckwheat-fodder radish/corn, bean/soybean, and buckwheat-white oat/ soybean), and T6 (wheat/corn, canola/corn + congo grass, and bean/soybean). The different crop rotations and the traditional second corn crop/soybean system provided positive energy balance and efficiency, that is, they produced more energy than they consumed. The canola/corn, crambe/corn, and canola/soybean rotation systems had the highest energy balance and efficiency, with values of 866,442.27 MJ ha -1 and 10.27, respectively, mainly due to corn cultivation in the summer, which resulted in a higher energy return than the other grain-producing crops.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43678/30394,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Germination potential of Hymenaea courbaril L. in different maturation stages,"The production of quality forest seedlings in large quantities is essential for the restoration of environments that have been deforested and degraded. However, obtaining seeds with high vigor is a challenge for several tree species native to Brazil. The objective of this work was to verify the germination potential of jatobá-da-mata seeds at different stages of maturation, in order to favor the production of seedlings of this species in nurseries. The seeds were extracted from green and ripe fruits detached from the mother plant and ripe fruits collected from the ground. The germination percentage, average germination time, emergence speed index, average speed, relative frequency, leaf area of the seedling, and length of the aerial part and root were measured. The planting was carried out with mechanically scarified and intact seeds from each maturation group. The results indicated that non-scarified green seeds can be used for planting and seedling production, as they do not require pre-germination treatment and have a favorable germination percentage (79%). Fruit seeds harvested from the ground, on the other hand, needed a method to overcome integumentary dormancy, such as mechanical scarification, obtaining a germination rate of 85%. The seeds of ripe fruits harvested in the matrix showed greater vigor, with a higher percentage of germination (96 to 100%), a higher emergence speed index, shorter average germination time, and seedlings with greater leaf area and greater length of shoot.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43751/30358,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Multivariate analysis to characterize flaxseed production environments in Brazil,"The environments for flaxseed production and its soil-plant-atmosphere relationship, it is essential for distinguish and adapt them to the soil and crop management to obtain high sustainable yields and food diversification. Our goal was to characterize the main edaphoclimatic conditions for flaxseed production in South-Central, Brazil. The experiments were carried out in two locations representative of the edaphoclimatic conditions of South-Central, Brazil: 1 - Dourados, MS, with an Aw climate and LATOSSOLO VERMELHO Distroférrico (Haplustox) and 2 - Curitibanos, SC, with a Cfb climate and CAMBISSOLO HÚMICO (Haplumbrept), both cultivated with four flaxseed varieties: Aguará and Caburé from Argentina, UFSC (reddish-brown color) and Golden (golden-yellow color) from Brazil, grown under no-tillage system and few resources. Data from weather (air temperature and rainfall), plant growth, soil chemical and physical-hydric attributes, and post-harvest quality of flaxseed were monitored. The data were submitted to Pearson’s correlation matrix (P < 0.05) and multivariate principal component analysis (PCA). PCA segregated edaphoclimatic environments and varieties into four distinct groups. Each edaphoclimatic condition there was specific attributes discriminated by PCA ( > 78%). The lowest plant height ( < 0.85m), shorter cycle length (120-142 days) and high yield ( =1.13 Mg ha-1), especially golden-yellow flaxseed, were found in Dourados. The soil organic carbon and rainfall acted directly in Curitibanos, while charge balance and air temperature responded in Dourados influence flaxseed production. Soil physical and grain attributes were similar between the environments investigated. Both agricultural environments showed feasibility for flaxseed sustainable production in Brazil, it is important to emphasize that these results are pioneers, especially the edaphoclimatic conditions from Dourados.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43882/30359,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Development and production of maize as a function of biochar rates,"Poultry litter biochar has shown to be promising in crop development and production. On this basis, this study was developed to investigate the influence of increasing rates of poultry litter biochar on the growth and production of maize hybrid BRS 2022. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with six biochar rates (0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.1, 8.1 and 10.1 t ha-1) and four replicates. Plots consisted of pots with a volume of 20 dm3, with one plant each. The following variables were evaluated at 83 days after sowing: plant height; first-ear insertion height; stem diameter; number of leaves; leaf area; internode length and number; stem, leaf and total dry weights; ear weight; grain weight per plant; 1000-grain weight; and ear length and diameter. Biochar application influenced plant height; first-ear insertion height; stem diameter; leaf area; internode length; and stem, leaf and total dry weights, having a positive impact in increasing in ear weight, grain weight per plant, 1000-grain weight and ear length and diameter. For the conditions in which the experiment was conducted, the recommended biochar rate to obtain the best results is 6.4 t ha-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43939/30360,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Development of a cake rich in resistant starch with good sensory acceptance,"The objective of this study was to develop a cake rich in resistant starch, with green banana flour (GBF), of good sensory acceptance. In step 1, four cake formulations were prepared with increasing concentrations of GBF and evaluated for acceptability and purchase intention. In step 2, four new formulations were made by modifying the most accepted formulation in step 1, in addition to the formulation without GBF (control). The resistant starch content, proximate composition, total calorific value, and sensory acceptance data were obtained. The formulation with cocoa powder and dried banana (E1F4) achieved 97.78% overall acceptance and higher purchase intent. In step 2, the formulations with 14% and 18% GBF were the most accepted for flavor, texture/softness, and overall acceptance. Adding the categories of “would certainly buy” and “would probably buy”, 53.33% of consumers would buy the cake with 14% GBF and 48.89% would buy the cake containing 18% GBF. The incorporation of GBF increased the resistant starch contents of the formulations as compared with the control. Ash content was highest in the formulation with 26% GBF (2.22%) and lipid content in the control formulation (11.58%). The treatments did not differ in terms of moisture content. Protein content decreased as the GBF content in the formulations was increased. The total dietary fiber content of the formulations was 9.30%. Carbohydrate content and calorific value also did not vary. The mean values of L*, a*, b*, C*, and h* showed that the cakes had an intense dark brown color. In conclusion, the addition of 14% and 18% GBF to the cake resulted in a product of high sensory acceptance, with high purchase intent, a resistant starch content 7.21 and 8.34 times higher than those in the control cake.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43220/30362,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Evaluation of traditional Brazilian sausage (linguiça calabresa) elaborated with oregano and basil extracts as natural antioxidants,"This study aimed to evaluate traditional Brazilian sausage (linguiça calabresa) elaborated with oregano and basil extracts as natural antioxidants. Hydroalcoholic extracts of dried oregano and basil leaves were prepared, freeze-dried, and evaluated for antioxidant activity by Folin-Ciocalteu, DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS assays. Freeze-dried oregano extract showed higher (p < 0.05) antioxidant activity than freeze-dried basil extract by all methods. Extracts were used in preparations of seven sausage formulations, as follows: F1, 0.05% oregano extract and 0.05% basil extract; F2, 0.1% oregano extract and 0.05% basil extract; F3, 0.05% oregano extract and 0.1% basil extract; F4, 0.075% oregano extract and 0.075% basil extract, F5, 0.1% oregano extract and 0.1% basil extract; F6 (control), without extract; and F7, 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Sausage formulations were analyzed for chemical composition, pH, acidity, water activity, lipid oxidation, color, and texture. Formulations showed differences in pH at different storage periods. F1, F2, F3, and F7 had the lowest (p < 0.05) lipid oxidation values at 53 days of storage. F1, F2, F6, and F7 showed higher a* values and lower b* values. Hardness and chewiness decreased (p < 0.05) during storage for all formulations. F1, F2, and F3 had similar efficiency to that with synthetic antioxidant BHT (F7), therefore, oregano and basil extracts have potential application as natural antioxidants in the food industry.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43363/30775,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Intercurrence between bovine leukosis virus infection and mastitis in dairy cattle,"There are several factors affecting global milk production leading to severe economic losses. Mastitis and leukosis are highly prevalent diseases especially in Brazilian cattle herds. The present study aimed to evaluate the correlation between mastitis and the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in naturally infected cows belonging to dairy herds in Minas Gerais State. Additionally, the prevalence of both diseases, pathogens causing mastitis, and their association with BLV infection and persistent lymphocytosis were evaluated. The prevalence of BLV was determined using the agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) in 1,392 lactating cows from ten dairy herds. From the AGID results, 240 cows were selected and divided into two experimental groups: A case group composed of 160 BLV-positive cows (BLV-P) and the control group of 80 BLV-negative cows (BLV-N). Based on serological and leucocytic evaluations, the animals were classified into three subgroups: BLV-N, BLV-P without persistent lymphocytosis (BLV-PWPL), and BLV-positive with persistent lymphocytosis (BLV-PPL). The California Mastitis Test (CMT) was performed on days 0 (D0) and 60 (D60) in the subgroups and the milk from CMT-positive glands were analyzed. BLV infection was present in 100% of herds, with an overall prevalence of 80.9% in cows older than 24 months. Among BLV-P animals, 74% were classified as BLV-PWPL and 26% as BLV-PPL. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (73.30%), Corynebacterium spp. (12.04%), Streptococcus agalactiae (8.90%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.76%) were predominant (61.41%). There were no statistical differences among the scores of clinical or subclinical mastitis with the pathogen type (contagious or environmental) in the BLV-PWPL or BLV-PPL subgroups. However, BLV-P animals showed higher CMT scores than BLV-N animals, suggesting a higher predisposition to subclinical mastitis in cows affected by leukosis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43063/30408,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Buffering capacity and fecal pH in healthy horses submitted to experimental enteral nutrition,"This study set out to determine the impacts of a commercial equine enteral nutrition product on fecal pH, buffering capacity (BC) and physical examination variables. Eight healthy horses were randomly allocated to one of two simultaneous experimental groups in a 4×4 Latin square design. Horses were submitted to 12 hours of solid fasting, then fed increasing doses of the test product via nasogastric tube, as follows: 0% (pure water), 50%, 75% and 100% of the daily recommended dose. Test product doses were diluted in water (1:3) and delivered by bolus feeding. Fecal samples were taken directly from the rectal ampulla prior to (T0) and within 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours of product administration (T3, T6, T12, T24, T36 and T48 respectively). Within 24 to 36 hours of product administration, fecal pH was near 6 (p = 0.01). However, dose variation had no effect on pH. Product dose and sample collection time had a significant impact (p = 0.00) on buffering capacity at pH 6. The more dramatic drop in pH occurred within 24 to 36 hours of product administration, except in horses receiving the 0% dose (water). At pH 5, buffering capacity was affected by dose but not by sample collection time. Soft fecal consistency, increased intestinal motility and fat droplets in fecal samples were noted in most horses. Fecal pH and buffering capacity assessment are indirect tests. Still, results obtained from these tests were deemed useful for detection of intestinal changes, particularly when combined with physical examination. The product had an impact on faecal pH, buffering capacity and intestinal motility, therefore, it is recommended that the formulation be revised.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43099/30365,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effects of insulin on sperm cell quality in ram semen cooled at 5°C,"Insulin is present in the seminal plasma and is involved in sperm activities like motility and capacitation. However, the effects of insulin on the viability of cooled ram sperm are not fully understood. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of insulin addition on ram sperm maintained at 5ºC. Sperm samples were collected from six healthy, mature Santa Inês rams. The ejaculates were divided into two aliquots with (insulin group) or without (control group) insulin (3 IU mL-1) in the semen extender, and then cooled at 5°C for 48 hours. Subsequently, the sperm cells were evaluated for motility and kinetics using computer-assisted semen analysis. The samples were evaluated for acrosomal integrity by fluorescein using isothiocyanate combined with peanut agglutinin (FITC-PNA) and membrane functionality by the hypoosmotic swelling test. The semen analysis was performed after 24 or 48 hours of cooling. There was an increased percentage of progressive sperm motility (%), straightness (%), linearity (%) and beat caudal frequency (Hz) in the insulin group after 24 and 48 hours of cooling (p < 0.05). However, insulin did not affect total sperm motility, sperm velocities (VSL, VAP and VCL) (µm seg-1), acrosomal integrity and membrane functionality during cooling (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the addition of 3 IU mL-1 insulin to ram semen extender improved the quality of sperm motility after cooling.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43389/30366,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Multidrug resistance in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolated from broiler chickens at slaughter,"Broiler chickens and derived products are a key source of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in humans. This pathotype is responsible for causing severe episodes of diarrhea, which can progress to systemic complications. A rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease, and early treatment of the infection with antimicrobials, can prevent it worsening. However, multidrug-resistant strains have potentially negative implications for treatment success. In this context, the aim of the present study was to isolate and identify multidrug-resistant STEC strains from broiler chickens and carcasses. Of 171 E. coli strains, isolated by conventional microbiological techniques and submitted to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), for detection of stx1 and stx2 genes, 21.05% (36/171) were STEC pathotype, and most of them (66.67% - 24/36) carried both stx1 and eae genes. The multidrug resistance pattern was observed in 75% (27/36) of STEC strains. The presence of STEC in broiler chickens and carcasses reinforces that these sources may act as reservoirs for this pathotype. Multidrug-resistant bacteria contaminating animal products represent a public health issue because of the possibility of spread of multidrug-resistant determinants in the food chain and a higher risk of failure in human treatment when antimicrobials are needed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43786/30367,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Nelore females (n = 531) were allocated according to the following categories: nulliparous (n = 144), primiparous (n = 132), and multiparous (n = 255). The animals received a conventional TAI protocol, and estrus expression was identified by the absence of paint in the sacrococcygeal region on the day of TAI. Females that did not show estrus were treated with 10 µg of GnRH together with insemination. The rates of estrus and pregnancy were analyzed using a logistic regression model (P < 0.05). The estrus expression was lower (P = 0.006) in the primiparous (61.36%) group than in the nulliparous (76.39%) and multiparous (75.69%) groups. Similar pregnancy rates were observed in females that showed estrus (nulliparous 84.54%, primiparous 86.42%, and multiparous 80.31%; P = 0.39) and in females that did not show estrus and received GnRH (nulliparous 41.18%, primiparous 56.86%, and multiparous 58.06%; P = 0.24). The total pregnancy rates were also similar (P = 0.98) among the categories (nulliparous 74.3%, primiparous 75.0%, and multiparous 74.9%). The primiparous females had a lower rate of estrus, and the pregnancy rates were similar among the categories that received GnRH.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43841/30368,E-ISSN 1679-0359

It is a multifactorial disease whose etiology involves several microorganisms, detaching Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobials are the basis for treating this illness; however, due to the increase in antimicrobial resistance, conventional drugs have become ineffective, requiring the search for alternative therapies. In this context, essential oils (EOs) have great therapeutic potential due to their broad antimicrobial action. This study aimed to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in order to measure the MIC50 and MIC90 of gentamicin and EOs of Eugenia caryophyllata, Thymus vulgaris, Cymbopogon winterianus, Cymbopogon citratus, and Cinnamomum cassia against 62 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the external acoustic meatus of dogs. All EOs showed antibacterial action against the studied microorganisms, and their MIC50 and MIC90 were as follows: Eugenia caryophyllata, 2.42 mg mL-1 and 7.25 mg mL-1; Thymus vulgaris, 9.51 mg mL-1 and 22.94 mg mL-1; Cymbopogon winterianus, 26.78 mg mL-1 and 157.79 mg mL-1; Cinnamomum cassia and Cymbopogon citratus, lower than 16.48 and 27.81 mg mL-1, with the same MIC for all isolates. The MIC50 and MIC90 found for gentamicin were 1ug mL-1and 8 ug mL-1. The MIC range found to antibiotic in this assay was 0.5 ug mL-1to 128 ug mL-1, and the isolates were classified as susceptible [48 strains (77.41%) - MIC range of 0.5-4.0 ug mL-1], intermediate [eight strains (12.90%) - (MIC = 8.0 ug mL-1], or resistant [six strains (9.68%) - MIC bigger, smaller 16 ug mL-1]. The results, according to the in vitro assays, showed that resistance to gentamicin, one of the antimicrobials most commonly used to treat canine otitis, is present in the Staphylococcus aureus population evaluated. Additionally, the tested EOs have great potential for therapeutic use, however future studies should be carried out to evaluate their in vivo efficacy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43895/30369,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Ocimum gratissimum essential oil improved the health, innate immunity and resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila infection in Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum","The essential oil of alfavaca (Ocimum gratissimum) contains important compounds, such as 1.8-cineol and eugenol. This study evaluated the effects of diets containing alfavaca essential oil on the zootechnical performance, plasma glucose, leukocyte respiratory activity, haematology, and intestinal histomorphometry in “cachara” (Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum) challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila. A total of 300 juvenile fish, with an average total length of 14.98 ± 0.28 cm and average weight of 18.84 ± 1.22 g, distributed in 20 tanks of 80 L, were fed twice a day with a diet containing essential oil at 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5% or without its inclusion in five replicates. After 45 days, blood collection and mid-intestinal bowel were sampled, before a challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila was performed. The fish supplemented with 1.0% of essential oil presented better weight gain, mean corpuscular volume, concentration of thrombotic and neutrophils, respiratory activity of leukocytes, and height of villi (p < 0.05) when compared to other groups. The cumulative mortality response was lower for fish fed 1.5% essential oil of alfavaca diets. Thus, the use of alfavaca essential oil is recommended in the diet of cachara catfish (P. reticulatum) at the level of up to 1.0% for 45 days for improvements in the zootechnical, haematological, and intestinal histomorphometric parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43973/30420,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"First detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes in the Mearim River Watershed, Maranhão State, Brazil","The Mearim River Watershed has multiple uses e.g. leisure, navigation, fishing and subsistence agriculture and constitutes the main source of supply for the populations of municipalities situated along its course. In addition to being a water supply source, the existence of the ‘pororoca’ (tidal bore) effect in a stretch of the lower course of the Mearim River attracts people from several Brazilian states and different countries, as it offers excellent conditions for surfing in fresh water. In this respect, given the importance of the watershed, this study was developed to report the detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes in a stretch of the lower course of the Mearim River, located in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. Thirty water samples were collected from 10 sampling points. To quantify E. coli, the chromogenic enzymatic system was used and positive samples were isolated and biochemically identified. Pure cultures underwent DNA extraction by heating followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) characterization. At the time of the collections, an observation schedule was used to record information on the existence of rearing of livestock and domestic animals; businesses; residences; and fruit and vegetable farming on the riverbanks. The samples were analyzed for the mean populations of E. coli, which ranged from 444 to 2,585 MPN mL-1. Twenty bacterial isolates were identified and the diarrheal pathotypes ETEC, typical EPEC and atypical EPEC were detected. The detection of these pathotypes can represent an epidemiological risk and compromise several uses of this water resource, such as irrigation of fruits and vegetables consumed raw, fishing, animal watering and recreation. Structural investments in basic sanitation are essential to minimize environmental degradation resulting from anthropic activities and to act preventively in public health. In addition, the recovery of riparian forests along the watershed and the maintenance of vegetation in these areas are measures to reduce the transport of particles from the soil to the watercourses, improving the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of this water resource.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/44148/30418,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Meat quality of lambs fed phytogenic additives,"The study was developed in the Sheep Production Laboratory of the Department of Animal Science, College of Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences, São Paulo State University, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil. Thirty-two non-castrated Ile de France lambs weighing 20.0 ± 0.2 kg received 4 diets with a roughage: concentrate ratio of 40: 60. The experimental treatments consisted of D1: corn silage + concentrate; D2: corn silage + concentrate + 30 mg rosemary extract kg body weight1; D3: corn silage + concentrate + 30 mg green tea extract kg body weight-1; and D4: corn silage + concentrate + 30 mg oregano extract kg body weight-1, up to 35.0 ± 0.2 kg body weight. The objectives were to evaluate rib eye area, cholesterol content, lipid oxidation, qualitative parameters, as well as perform sensory analysis, centesimal composition, and fatty acid profile of the meat. The experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments and eight replicates. The treatments were compared by Tukey’s test through the SAS software (Statistical Analysis System Institute [SAS], 2003). Inclusion of phytogenic additives into the diets did not affect the qualitative parameters cholesterol content, lipid oxidation, and centesimal composition (except for protein content, which was lower in D2, 22.57%, compared to D1, 25.62%), as well as meat fatty acid profile (except for C18: 1n7 cis-vaccenic). The use of phytogenic additives provided suitable qualitative parameters. Moreover, despite the well-known positive effect of antioxidants in the diet, phytogenic additive inclusion was ineffective in reducing lipid oxidation in lamb meat. However, further studies with different inclusion percentages should be carried out to find out how to increase shelf life without harming lamb qualitative parameters, especially regarding the sensory analysis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42749/30395,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Carcass and beef quality of crossbred cattle fed increasing linseed oil levels,"Strategies to improve beef nutritional value, mainly fatty acid composition, have been a major goal for the scientific community. The use of different oil contents, mostly those rich in unsaturated fatty acids, can be interesting for cost reduction, as well as cattle performance and meat quality improvements. This study assessed the influence of diets containing increasing linseed oil levels (1.0, 3.8, and 5.2% DM) on performance, carcass traits, and meat quality of feedlot-finished Nellore x Canchim steers and heifers. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design and arranged in a mixed 3 x 2 factorial scheme. Increasing oil levels linearly decreased dry matter intake (DMI) (P < 0.05) and hence improved feed efficiency (P < 0.05), regardless of sexual condition. A beneficial effect of increasing the inclusion of linseed oil was the reduction DMI. Steers had a higher weight at slaughter (P < 0.05) and heifers had greater backfat thickness (P < 0.05). The concentrations of most fatty acids were changed by the linseed oil levels studied (P < 0.05). Dietary inclusion of linseed oil improved beef quality by reducing (P < 0.05) the n-6:n-3 ratio by 1.3 points per percentage point increase in linseed oil level in the finishing diet of both sexes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42764/30374,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effects of glutamine and glutamate on nursery piglets fed diets with different digestible lysine content,"The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of glutamine and glutamate (Gln/Glu) on the growth performance and immune response of nursery pigs fed different digestible lysine content. Two hundred and sixteen piglets, weaned at 21 days old, were assigned to a randomized block design according to their initial body weight (BW), in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with two levels of lysine (control-lys and low lys) and two levels of Gln/Glu (0 and 12 g kg-1), with nine replicates. At 26d, piglets consuming the low lys diet not supplemented with Gln/Glu presented a higher (P < 0.01) incidence of diarrhea than the other treatments. From 21 to 32 d of age, the piglets fed the control lys diets performed better than those fed low lys diets (P < 0.01). From 21 to 42 d of age, there was a correlation (P < 0.01) between lysine level and Gln/Glu supplementation for average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion (FC). Gln/Glu supplementation improved (P < 0.05) the ADFI of pigs fed the low-lys diets, resulting in a higher (P < 0.01) average daily weight gain (ADG) and BW; however, worse (P < 0.05) FC. Piglets consuming control lys diets had higher (P < 0.0) serum urea nitrogen concentration (SUN) and IgG than low lys piglets. In addition, Gln/Glu supplementation correlated with higher (P < 0.01) SUN. Dietary supplementation of glutamine and glutamate improved the growth performance of weaned piglets from 21 to 42 days of age, regardless of the diets lysine levels. In addition, reducing lysine levels 10% below the requirement negatively affects the growth performance and the immune response of nursery piglets.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42775/30375,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Discrimination study between the carcass and non-carcass components for interaction between gender, age, and production system in indigenous sheep","The objective of this work was to evaluate the yields, morphometric measures, carcass, and non-carcass components, and carcass regional and tissue composition of an indigenous sheep (Pantaneiro) of different physiological stages (gender, age, system production). Demonstrate the productive potential of locally adapted animals is essential for their conservation, and also identify characteristics that need improvement without losing their adaptability. Thirty sheep, eleven lambs, nine wethers, and ten cull ewes were used. The lambs were finished in feedlots, the wethers were maintained on pastures and supplementation, and the cull ewes were maintained on an extensive pasture system with mineral salt ad libitum. Slaughter ages were defined to simulate the most representative products and farming systems. Animals were slaughtered and classified as non- castrated lambs, wethers, and cull ewes. The criteria to slaughter lambs and wethers were the body condition, which ranged from 2.5 to 3.0. Cull ewes were slaughtered based on negative pregnancy diagnosis, regardless of their body condition, which ranged from 4.0 to 4.5. All animals were slaughtered after 16-hours of fasting (solids). The ewes presented the greatest fat thickness, differing significantly from the lambs. The morphometric measures were higher in ewes and lambs. The muscle to fat ratio of the animal's cuts from different physiological stages presented no significant differences. The indigenous Pantaneiro sheep have good potential for meat production regardless of their physiological stages. The ewes stood out, presenting carcasses with good performance considering their potential and longer permanence in the herd due to their reproductive function.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42879/30376,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Which non-fibrous carbohydrates: neutral detergent fiber ratio optimizes the use of cactus cladodes in diets of growing heifers?,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC):neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ratios (0.70:1, 0.90:1, 1.14:1, 1.42:1, and 1.85:1) in diets containing cactus cladodes on intake, digestibility, ruminal parameters, ingestive behavior, and microbial protein of growing heifers. Five rumen-cannulated heifers (194 ± 70 kg of body weight) were distributed in a Latin square design (5 x 5). There was a quadratic effect on the intake of dry matter (DM) (Kg day-1 and %BW) and crude protein (CP) with the increase in non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC): neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ratio, with maximum values of 7.07 kg day-1, 2.86%, and 0.949 kg day-1, estimated for 1.37:1, 1.39:1, and 1.27:1 ratios. When the intake of NDF decreased, in turn, the intakes of NFC and TDN increased. The NDF digestibility decreased with increasing NFC levels in diets. The other nutrients were not influenced. The ruminal pH showed the lowest values at 4 hours after feeding, mainly for animals fed the 1.85:1 ratio. There was a quadratic effect for rumination time with maximum values estimated for an NFC:NDF ratio of 0.88:1. The time spent idle increased linearly, while total chewing time and feeding efficiency of NDF decreased. The urinary volume increased linearly. However, microbial protein synthesis and the efficiency of the synthesis were not influenced. The number of protozoa increased by 64.5% with the elevation of the NFC:NDF ratio. We recommend a NFC:NDF ratio of 1.37:1 in diets containing cactus cladodes, to improve the use of nutrients, without negatively affecting ruminal parameters.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42894/30377,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Beef cow weight variations during gestation and offspring performance: a meta-analysis,"The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of weight loss or weight gain of beef cows during the second and/or third trimester of gestation on the postnatal performance of the progeny. The variation in cow weight during the gestational period was calculated to standardize the treatments, being them: severe loss (SL = cows that lost more than 10% of weight); moderate loss (ML = cows that lost from 0 to 10% of weight) and weight gain (WG = cows that gained weight). The intensity of the cow weight variation effect was calculated as the mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval and heterogeneity determined using the Q test and the I2 statistic. A meta-analysis of random effects was conducted for each indicator separately with the means of the control and experimental groups. Calves from WG cows were higher for birth weight (P = 0.0094); weight adjusted to 205 days (P = 0.0127) and average daily gain during pre-weaning (P < 0.0001) in relation to calves from ML cows. The W205 of calves from SL cows was 11.6 kg lower than the progeny from ML cows. The post-weaning performance of the progeny tended (P = 0.0868) to be higher in the progeny of WG cows than ML ones.

2021,42,Covariance functions under B-spline polynomials to model Polled Nellore cattle growth,"B-spline functions have been used in random regression models (RRM) to model animal weight from birth to adulthood because they are less vulnerable to common difficulties of other methods. However, its application to model growth traits of Polled Nellore cattle has been little studied. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate polynomial functions of different orders and segment numbers to model effects associated with the Polled Nellore cattle growth curve. For this purpose, we used 15,148 weight records of 3,115 animals aged between 1 and 660 days and reared in northern Brazil and born between 1995 and 2010. Random effects were modeled using B-spline polynomials. As random effects, we considered the direct and maternal genetic additives, as well as direct and maternal permanent environments. As fixed effects were included contemporary group, cow age at calving (linear and quadratic) and fourth-order Legendre polynomials to represent average growth curve. The residue was modeled by considering seven age classes. The best-fitted model was the one that considered cubic B-spline functions with four knots for direct additive genetic effects and three knots for maternal genetic, animal permanent environment, and maternal permanent environment effects (C6555). Therefore, covariance functions under B-spline polynomials are efficient and can be used to model the growth curve of Polled Nellore cattle from birth to 660 days of age.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43198/30410,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The treatments consisted of elephant grass cv. BRS capiaçu (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) ensiled with 37.44% banana peel hay, 36.06% banana pseudostem hay and 37.00% banana leaf hay, on a dry matter (DM) basis and control silage (no additive). The experimental design used was completely randomized, with five treatments and five replicates. Forage was collected when it reached 3.5 meters in height (90 days). Experimental PVC silos of known weight, 50 cm long, 10 cm diameter, were used for silage making. For all treatments, silage aerobic stability breakdown started after 64 hours exposure to air. The BRS capiaçu grass control silage or silage combined with pseudostem hay (mean of 73.15 kg t GM-1) presented effluent losses 40.46% higher than those observed for BRS capiaçu grass silage + banana leaf hay and 69.17% in relation the BRS capiaçu grass silage + banana peel hay. The inclusion of banana crop residue (hay) when ensiling BRS capiaçu grass decreased 13.93% gas losses compared to the control silage (mean of 3.11% DM). Higher values of total digestible nutrients, metabolizable energy and digestible energy content was found in BRS capiaçu grass silage + with banana peel hay. The greater in vitro dry matter digestibility and in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility was observed for BRS capiaçu grass silage combined with pseudostem hay.

2021,42,Metabolizable energy levels in diets with a fixed nutrient:calorie ratio for free-range broilers,"The present study proposes to examine the effect of dietary levels of metabolizable energy, under a fixed nutrient:calorie ratio, on the production performance; body fat and protein deposition; and carcass characteristics of free-range broilers from 1 to 84 days of age. Nine hundred unsexed chicks were allocated to six treatments in a completely randomized design with six replicates of 25 birds each. Treatments consisted of diets with varying levels of metabolizable energy (2700, 2800, 2900, 3000, 3100 and 3200 Kcal ME/kg of diet) and a fixed proportion of nutrients relative to the energy level according to the nutritional requirements for each rearing phase. Body weight, weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion, production viability, metabolizable energy intake, protein intake, lysine intake, body fat deposition, body protein deposition and carcass characteristics were evaluated. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and, later, to regression analysis. Increasing levels of metabolizable energy, coupled with a fixed nutrient:calorie ratio, reduced feed intake, increased body weight and weight gain, improved feed conversion and did not affect carcass characteristics. In conclusion, adjusting the nutrient supply according to the dietary energy level improves production performance by improving feed conversion, ensuring adequate nutrient intake and preserving fat and protein deposition in the carcass when the metabolizable energy level is raised up to 3200 Kcal/kg in all rearing stages.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43403/30427,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Kleiber ratios and growth curves of African Black and Red Neck ostrich breeds and their crossbreeds,"The selection of animals with lower production costs can be achieved by using feed efficiency and growth curve information. Kleiber ratio (KR) is an alternative option for discriminating against the animals that have the greatest weight gain about their final weight. Alternative feed efficiency and growth curves for ostriches of the African Black (AB) and Red Neck (RN) breeds and their crossbreeds (CB) were investigated using KR and Gompertz equation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used. The highest adult weight was identified in the RN and CB. AB was more precocious than the RN and CB individuals. Only AB animals reached 75% of their mature weight at one year of age. At 180 days, AB showed better KR. AB was different from the others, mainly for KR at 90 days and 180 days. Considering multivariate analysis, AB animals were different from the others, regardless of sex, mainly for KR at 90 days and KR at 180 days. Other subgroups separated the animals by sex. In a market preferring animals of minor structure (smaller cuts) and greater precocity, it would be suitable to opt for AB. When animals with greater body structure (larger cuts) are desired, males RN and CR is the best option, however, it will be slaughtered with greater age and lower value for KR (may generate a bigger production cost ).

2021,42,Mombaça grass yield as a function of nitrogen fertilization based on the use of the chlorophyll meter,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the yield and agronomic efficiency of mombaça grass achieved with the management of nitrogen fertilization, based on the nitrogen sufficiency index (NSI) calculated using measurements obtained with a chlorophyll meter. The experiment was conducted in the field, in São Luís de Montes Belos - GO, Brazil, from November 2016 to May 2018, as a randomized-block design with six treatments and five replicates. Treatments consisted of six N fertilization management strategies (M), namely, M1 - reference, with 150 kg ha-1 N per application; M2 - recommended, with 50 kg ha-1 N per application; M3 - 50 kg ha-1 N when NSI < 98%; M4 - 50 kg ha-1 N when NSI < 94%; M5 - 50 kg ha-1 N when NSI < 90%; and M6 - control treatment, without N application. The NSI was monitored based on the relative chlorophyll content obtained with the chlorophyll meter. Forage canopy height, tiller density, and yield were evaluated. At the end of the 2nd cycle, the recommended, reference, NSI98%, NSI94%, and NSI90% treatments had received 1,050, 350, 300, 250, and 0 kg N ha-1. Control treatment obtained the lowest dry biomass yield, whereas the recommended, NSI98%, and NSI94% treatments showed the highest. Thus, N doses between 1,950 and 300 kg ha-1, in the second cycle, provided statistically equivalent yields in mombaça grass. Considering the DM of both evaluation cycles, the highest yield was achieved with the NSI98% and NSI94% treatments. The application of N doses of 250 to 1050 kg ha-1 provided similar yields. Therefore, the adoption of a nitrogen sufficiency index below 98% and 94% as a parameter allows a reduction and rational use of nitrogen fertilizer.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43778/30387,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Alfalfa harvested at the beginning of blooming (5th cutting) was withered under laboratory conditions for 48 hours. In the study, 4 different levels of whipped cream were used, and no additives were added to the control group. A total of 20 packages of silage were left for fermentation in a closed storage (16±2 °C) for 90 days, 4 repetitions for each group. As a results of this study dry matter (DM) contents of silages increased due to the increase in the level of whipped cream addition. pH of silages was decreased significantly in the groups that participated in 20 ve 30 g kg-1 of whipped cream compared to the control (P < 0.01). In these groups, crude protein (CP) amount was higher (P < 0,01), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) was lower (P < 0.01) than control and other whipped cream groups. The water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) contents increased in parallel with the increase in the whipped cream level added to the alfalfa, and lactic acid (LA), as for that, was determined to be the highest (80.40 g kg-1 DM) level in the group with 30 g kg-1 whipped cream. In the same group, neutral detergent fiber (NDF: 383.1 g kg-1 DM) and acid detergent fiber (ADF: 245.4 g kg-1 DM) were observed to be at the lowest level, yeast numbers decreased similarly, enterobacter and mold did not develop, and RFV increased. According to the results obtained from the study, it was demonstrated that by adding 20 or 30 mg kg-1 of whipped cream to alfalfa, quality alfalfa silage could be obtained, and the waste whipped cream can be used as a silage additive and can be recycled to the economy.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43929/30389,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Intake and digestibility of nutrients during the grazing period in sheep on deferred marandu pastures with four initial heights,"The objective of this study was to verify the effect of reducing in pasture height at the beginning of the deferment period (PHBD) of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu on nutrient intake and digestibility in sheep during winter. The combinations between average sward heights (15, 25, 35 and 45 cm) at the beginning of the deferment period and the times of sward use during the winter were evaluated; intake and digestibility evaluations were carried out at the beginning, middle and end of the grazing period, which lasted 90 days. The experimental design used was completely randomized, with three replications. The parameters evaluated were: intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and potentially digestible dry matter (pDDM). The pDDM contents were similar in pastures kept with 15 and 25 cm, but higher than those observed in pastures with 35 and 45 cm at the beginning of the deferment period. The NDF contents were lower and the CP and NDF digestibility were higher in 15 and 25 cm deferred pastures than in 35 cm at the beginning of deferment period, except for pastures lowered to 45cm. The improvement in nutritional value of the forage apparently ingested by sheep, promoted by ISP reduction, did not result in a variation in pasture consumption by the animals. DMI, expressed as percentage of body weight (%BW), ranged from 1.10 to 1.63. At the beginning of the grazing period, higher values of pDDM, CP and DM digestibility (DMD) were verified in simulated grazing samples. The same response pattern observed for nutritional value traits also occurred for DMI (g.day-1 and %BW) and CP intake. These were higher at the beginning, than at the middle and end of the grazing period. The use of lower sward heights at the beginning of the deferment period allowed the production of pasture with better nutritional quality, but these changes in the nutritional value of the pasture were insufficient to result in higher nutrient intake and digestibility. Furthermore, there was a reduction in nutritional value of the forage apparently consumed by sheep, in the intake and digestibility of deferred pastures throughout the grazing period, in winter. The lower pastures at the beginning of the deferment period (15 cm) improves the nutritional value of forage and nutrient digestibility at the beginning of the winter grazing period. The nutritional value and intake of deferred forage by sheep are compromised by the grazing period.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43963/30390,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effects of replacing Tifton-85 hay by cactus pear (Opuntia stricta Haw) on the carcass traits and meat quality of crossbred Santa Inês lambs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the carcass traits of crossbred Santa Inês lambs fed with increasing levels (0, 300, 600, and 900 g kg-1 on a dry matter basis) of cactus pear cv Mexican elephant ear (Opuntia stricta Haw) as a replacement for Tifton-85 hay. Forty-eight male lambs (noncastrated), averaging 21.0 ± 2.93 kg body weight (BW) at the beginning of the study, were used in this trial. Replacement levels of Tifton hay by cactus pear affected the hot carcass and cold carcass weights and the carcass compactness index linearly (P < 0.05), but did not influence the yield of hot carcass and cold carcass, the loin eye area, conformation, finishing, and subcutaneous fat thickness, the yield of commercial cuts and tissue composition of the leg (P > 0.05). The averages of tissue components yields were: muscle 64.94%, bone 16.92%, fat 14.92%, and other tissues 2.71%. There was also no effect (P > 0.05) of treatments on other measurements in Longissimus dorsi. However, there was an increasing linear effect on ether extract content (P < 0.05). It can be concluded that the Mexican Elephant Ear cactus pear can be used to feed finishing lambs, replacing up to 900 g kg-1 of the dry matter of the roughage, with a consequent increase in carcass weight, loin, shoulder, and leg, as well as, in the percentage of ether extract of the meat. However, it does not alter the other carcass traits and physical-chemical characteristics of the meat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43688/30391,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,First report of injuries associated with triclopyr herbicide drift in grapevines,"In the southern region of Brazil, close proximity of vineyards to soybean areas is common, and glyphosate is used frequently to allow for the control of weeds. However, the continuous use of this chemical has accelerated the process of selection for resistant species such as horseweed (Conyza sp.), thus leading to the search for alternative herbicides such as triclopyr to control this weed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report detailing injuries associated with triclopyr drift in grapevines in Brazil, in the Northern region of Parana state, that can result in crop losses that were previously uncharacterized. In this report, the primary symptoms associated with the drift of triclopyr in grapevines are described. Additionally, the major implications of this process regarding vine development along the next crop seasons are explored, and the primary measures to prevent these injuries are discussed.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43818/30421,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Root morphological traits of oil palm genotypes with differential resistance to fatal yellowing,"Brazil has an extensive area where the climate and soil are suitable for oil palm growing. However, in part of this area, production has been limited by the occurrence of the fatal yellowing (FY) anomaly, whose initial symptom is the rotting of absorptive roots. This symptom can be more severe in oil palm genetic materials with a smaller root system. The aim of this study was to examine morphological traits of roots and shoots of seedlings of three oil palm genotypes with different degrees of resistance to FY, namely, Tenera (sensitive), Caiaué (resistant) and Interspecific Hybrid (resistant) to provide bases to elucidate the differential resistance of these materials to FY. Shoot biomass did not vary statistically between the genetic materials. The mass, length and area of fine and very fine roots were significantly higher in the Interspecific Hybrid than in Caiaué and Tenera. The fine and very fine roots of Interspecific Hybrid had a larger mass than Caiaué (114 and 133%, respectively) and Tenera (216 and 178%, respectively). The Interspecific Hybrid also exhibited higher values for the length of fine and very fine roots than Caiaué (155 and 99% respectively) and Tenera (228 and 94% respectively). The root traits of the Interspecific Hybrid and Tenera are compatible with their differential resistance to FY. Our results demonstrate the importance of expanding the study of the relationship between root morphology and resistance to FY in these genetic materials under conditions that favor the occurrence of the anomaly, such as flooding.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40897/30043,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Performance of ‘Galia’ melon grown under different soil cation ratios,"The northeast region of Brazil stands out in the production and export of melon. In this region, where this crop is mostly grown, part of the soil is of limestone origin, as is the irrigation water used. Over successive cultivations, these conditions can lead to soil alkalinization due to the accumulation of basic cations of the exchange complex, such as Ca, Mg, K and Na, in soils that are already rich in bases, thus influencing nutrient availability and, consequently, crop yield. On this basis, this study was developed to identify the cation ratios (K:Mg:Ca) of the soil that best correlate with attributes indicative of ‘Gália’ melon production. Two experiments were carried out in two consecutive years (2017 and 2018), in a randomized-block design with five treatments and five replicates. Treatments consisted of the following cation ratios (K:Mg:Ca) for experiment I, whose soil had a K content of 0.40 cmolc dm-3: T1 (1:3:34), T2 (1:3:21), T3 (1:3:9), T4 (1:0.8:9) and T5 (1:11:34); and experiment II, where the soil had 0.56 cmolc dm-3 of K: T1 (1:1.6:29.8), T2 (1:1.4:13.3), T3 (1:1.4:8.5), T4 (1:0.5:8.5) and T5 (1:4.8:29.8). The following traits were evaluated: chemical analyses of the soil during the flowering phase and at the end of the cycle, nutrient concentration in the diagnostic leaf during the fruiting phase, total yield, marketable yield, average total weight, average marketable weight, total number of fruits and number of marketable fruits per plant. The cation ratios influenced the average total and marketable fruit weights only in experiment I, but not yield. Therefore, when associated with irrigation water from the Açu sandstone aquifer and fertigation, the high absolute K and medium to high Mg contents are sufficient to meet the K and Mg nutrient requirements, dispensing with correction of the cation ratio.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41051/30045,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Seed and seedling morphology of Bauhinia scandens L.,"Bauhinia scandens has potential importance as an ornamental and medicinal plant. Researchers have isolated and identified 1-O-alkylglycerol in the leaves of the B. scandens plant, and established antitumor properties using the Brine Shrimp toxicity test, an internationally accepted bioassay. Although this species has high potential, little is known about the viability of seedling production and the morphology of these plants, particularly in terms of seed characteristics and initial stages of germination. The objective of this study was to characterize the seed morphology, germination, and seedlings of B. scandens. Seed water content, weight, and coloration were evaluated. This study also included a description of seed biometrics, external and internal structures, germination, and seedling morphology. Internal seed morphology was evaluated by the anatomical sectioning and X-ray methods. The morphology data obtained were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis and germination data were determined using Cramér’s V. B. scandens seeds have a coloration ranging from very dark grayish-red to dark reddish-brown, flat oblong shapes, and rounded bases and apexes with full or slightly undulating margins. Healthy seedlings are produced mainly by seeds with well-formed internal structures. The reddish petiole of the seedling leaves is a taxonomic character for B. scandens identification. The non-domestication and genetic variability of this species reflect on the seed and seedling color and size variation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41656/30046,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The ‘Gem’ (‘3-29-5’) avocado is known for extending the marketing period of ‘Hass’-like avocados. This study aimed to evaluate the horticultural performance of ‘Gem’ avocado trees between the 4th and 6th years after planting (2016-2018), in a commercial orchard in the Central-Western region of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. ‘Gem’ avocado trees grafted onto seedling rootstocks were evaluated regarding tree size, shoot growth, flowering, and fruit yield, quality and maturation. In the evaluated biennium, the trees showed a strong upright growth habit and compact tree size. Flowering occurred mainly in indeterminate inflorescences. Fruit yield varied between 106.89 to 116.89 kg tree-1, and 75-91% of the fruit classified within size counts 12 (306 to 365 g/fruit) to 18 (211 to 235 g/fruit), and reached physiological maturity in late June, but could be picked until October, i.e, four to eight months later than ‘Hass’. ‘Gem’ is a new alternative for extending fruit offer of late-maturity avocado cultivars and allowing higher profit to the farmers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42780/30047,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Electrical conductivity test in the evaluation of the physiological potential of treated and stored soybean seeds,"Soybean seed treatment contributes to the maintenance of seed quality, but the effect of commercial formulations and chemical products on the effectiveness of the electrical conductivity test based on electrolyte leaching has been frequently questioned. This study aimed to verify the interference of the chemical seed treatment of two soybean cultivars on the effectiveness of the electrical conductivity test in evaluating the vigor of freshly treated and stored seeds. The experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of seven seed treatments and two evaluation periods (0 and 60 days after storage), with four replications. The used seed treatments consisted of 1) fipronil + pyraclostrobin + thiophanate-methyl, 2) imidacloprid + thiodicarb + carbendazim + thiram, 3) abamectin + thiamethoxan + fludioxonil + mefenoxam + thiabendazole, 4) carbendazim + thiram, 5) fludioxonil + mefenoxam + thiabendazole, 6) carboxin + thiram, and 7) control (no treatment). The cultivars were BRS 360 RR and BRS 284, which were analyzed separately. Germination, accelerated aging, emergence, and electrical conductivity tests were carried out. No differences were detected between the control and chemical treatments performed on seeds of the two freshly treated soybean cultivars regarding germination, accelerated aging, and emergence tests. The germination test stood out after storage with the cultivar BRS 360 RR, showing the maintenance of germination potential for seeds treated with carbendazim + thiram and the control treatment. Therefore, the chemical treatment of soybean seeds interferes with the result of the electrical conductivity test. The electrical conductivity test is effective in segregating seed lots in terms of vigor level. The electrical conductivity test correlates with the other vigor tests used to identify the reduction in the physiological seed quality with storage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42817/30078,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Physiological behavior of Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg. seedlings under flooding and shading,"Physiological information about native species, make it possible to know their potential for use in programs to recovery degraded areas. Nowadays climate changes are severe and factors as water and light are involved with plant development and growth. We hypothesized that shading may contribute to adjusting the characteristics of photosynthetic metabolism of Campomanesia xanthocarpa seedlings under flooding. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the flooding times and shading levels for gas exchanges and the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) in C. xanthocarpa seedlings. Seedlings were grown under two water regimes (control and flooding), three levels of shading (0, 30, and 70%) and 4 evaluation periods (0, 15, 30, and 45 days). We verified damages to the photosynthetic apparatus and reductions in the efficiency of the photochemical process under flooding and at a high level of shading (70%) in a short period (15 days). However, seedlings showed favourable responses to the adjustment over the 45 days of exposure to those conditions. According to the multivariate analysis, it was possible to identify the relation between photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance as the main factor of metabolic adjustments in the tolerance of C. xanthocarpa to flooding and high shading intensity. C. xanthocarpa was more sensitive to short periods of flooding conditions and full sun and high level of shading (70%), however, it presented better adjustment responses to flooding periods when associated with 30% shade.stas de ajuste aos períodos de alagamento quando associado ao 30% de sombra.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42926/30049,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Organic carbon mineralization of the biochar and organic compost of poultry litter in an Argisol,"The dynamics of the organic residues added to the soil are closely related to its mineralization rate. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the organic carbon mineralization in soil samples incubated with different doses of biochar and organic compost from poultry litter. Carbon mineralization was evaluated experimentally by measuring the C-CO2 liberated by incubating 200 g of soil mixed with different doses 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 t ha-1 of both biochar and organic compost for 61 days. The soil microbial activity, and consequently the carbon mineralization, increased with the application of doses of biochar and organic compost from the poultry litter. The highest C-CO2 mineralization was observed in the treatments that received organic compost. The carbon mineralization process followed chemical kinetics with two simultaneous reactions. The greatest amount of released and accumulated C-CO2 was observed in the soil incubated with 15 and 20 t ha-1 of organic compost from the poultry litter. The doses of biochar did not influence the content of mineralized carbon; this behavior was not verified with the use of this compost, whose highest content corresponded to 85.69 mg kg-1, applying 20 t ha-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43054/30050,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Physical-physiological quality and early performance of sorghum plants under different boron doses via seed,"Boron (B) deficiency is commonly found in tropical crops, among which sorghum stands out for its limited yield under B shortage. However, as a micronutrient, the range between its adequate and toxic levels is narrow, thus fertilization should be cautiously applied. Our goal was to evaluate the physiological and physical quality, as well as early performance, of grain sorghum seedlings under different B doses applied via seeds. Treatments consisted of six doses of boric acid (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 12.5 g Kg-1 seeds) plus a control (uncoated seeds). Boron doses were applied to seeds by coating, in which dolomitic limestone and glue were used for pellet formation. Coated seeds were assessed for physical, physiological, and nutritional characteristics in the laboratory, and early seedling performance was evaluated in a greenhouse. Seed tests were carried out in a fully randomized design, while seedling evaluations were carried out in a randomized block design. Boron application to seeds had no significant effect on seed physical characteristics, despite increases in coated seed sizes. Boron doses had a negative effect on the length and dry mass accumulation of both plant shoot and root. Seed-applied B accumulated mainly in roots and significantly interfered with Ca and Mg accumulations in sorghum seeds, shoots, and roots.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43107/30051,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Influence of foliar-applied glycinebetaine on growth, yield and some key physiological and biochemical attributes of grape (Vitis vinifera L.)","Glycinebetaine (GB) plays an imperative role to mitigate the opposing impact of several environmental stresses in various crops. The objective of this investigation was to scrutinize the response of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) to the foliar application of GB. Diverse levels of GB (0, 10, 20 and 30 mM) were applied three times with fifteen days interval to grape cv. King’s Ruby. All levels of GB improved the physiological, biochemical and growth attributes of the grape. As compared to control treatment, foliar spray of GB applied at 30 mM increased the number of leaves/vine, leaf area and number of newly emerged branches/plant by 20.55%, 12.28% and 48.13%, respectively. The pH of grape juice was decreased by increasing GB levels. However, total soluble solids, total chlorophyll contents, grape yield and photosynthesis rate was recorded maximum with foliar spray of GB applied at 30 mM. The regression model predicted that each increment in GB level enhanced the number of leaves/plant and the number of newly emerged branches/plant by 1.8 and 0.7, respectively. Thus, it is concluded that exogenous application GB applied at 30 mM might be more useful to obtain the optimum growth and quality of grapes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43226/30052,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Potassium nutrition as a strategy to mitigate salt stress in melon grown under protected cultivation,"The use of saline water is one of the major challenges of agriculture, as it can cause nutritional imbalances and thus reduce crop yield. This study proposes to examine the efficiency of potassium nutrition as a salt stress-mitigating agent in melon grown in a protected environment. The experiment was laid out in a randomized-block design with ten treatments in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement represented by two melon cultivars (McLaren and SV1044MF) and four nutrient solutions (S1 - standard nutrient solution, 2.5 dS m-1; S2 - nutrient solution salinized with NaCl, 5.0 dS m-1; S3 - nutrient solution salinized with NaCl + 50% K, 6.5 dS m-1; and S4 - nutrient solution salinized with NaCl + 100% K, 7.5 dS m-1). Yield (average fruit weight, production, fruit diameter, internal cavity, and pulp thickness), quality (pulp firmness, total sugars, soluble solids [SS], vitamin C, pH, titratable acidity [TA] and SS/TA ratio) and nutritional (K, Na and K/Na ratio) variables were evaluated. Plants fertigated with standard nutrient solution showed the highest values for fruit weight (1,190.6 g), production (2,381.3 g per plant), fruit diameter (13.6 cm) and pulp thickness (2.6 cm). Cultivar McLaren produced heavier fruits (931.4 g) with larger diameter (12.4 cm) and pulp thickness (2.4 cm). The addition of NaCl to nutrient solution induced a reduction in the yield variables but did not influence fruit quality. The addition of extra K to salinized nutrient solution did not mitigate the deleterious effect of salinity on the yield of melon.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43284/30054,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Effect of adding anethole to the cryopreservation medium (powdered coconut water) on morphology, kinetics, and oxidative stress of buck sperm","The quality of post-thawing goat sperm is critical to the success of artificial insemination protocols and may be influenced by extenders, cryoprotectants, and antioxidant substances. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the antioxidant anethole on goat sperm diluted in preservation medium based on powdered coconut water (ACP-101c) and frozen. For that, each ejaculate was submitted to the following treatments: ACP-101c (control); control plus supplementation with 30, 300, or 2000 µg/mL anethole. The samples were thawed and evaluated for morphology, kinetics, membrane integrity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of anethole increased morphological abnormalities (P < 0.05), however, it did not affect sperm kinetics. Flow cytometry analysis showed that sperm cells cryopreserved with 300 µg/mL anethole had lower acrosome integrity than those cryopreserved in other treatments. Evaluation of oxidative stress revealed that cells stored in the presence of 2000 µg/mL anethole had small amounts of ROS when compared to those preserved in the control medium alone or supplemented with 300 µg/mL anethole (P < 0.05). After cryopreservation of sperm with 2000 µg/mL anethole, the highest percentage of viable sperm without ROS was observed (P < 0.05). In conclusion, despite reducing ROS levels, the supplementation of anethole in ACP-101c did not affect sperm kinetics or membrane integrity post-thawing, however, it did cause morphological damage to sperm.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41847/30348,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Histological evaluation of the intestine of broiler chickens: comparison of three sampling methods,"After the growth-promoting antibiotics prohibition, intestinal health became an increasing concern worldwide in poultry farming. The intestinal histological evaluation is an inexpensive technique that brings relevant information, but in poultry, the immediate process of intestinal post-mortem autolysis interferes directly on the samples quality for histological analysis hindering a precise diagnosis. This study aimed to standardize a technique for broilers’ intestines sample collection and fixation for histological analysis. Seven broiler chickens received a standard diet until 23 days of age when they were euthanized. Fragments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected using three methods: intestine strips, transverse section, and Swiss roll and posteriorly fixed in 10% buffered formalin and bouin solution. Tissue samples were submitted for histological (number of villi and viable villi per field) and morphometrical (villi height, crypt depth and villi:crypt ratio) evaluations and the results analyzed statistically. A significant high number of villi and viable villi per field in all regions was observed in the Swiss roll method. In the duodenum (p= 0.0066) and jejunum (p= 0.0058) an interaction between the Swiss roll method and the fixative buffered formalin was observed in the viable and number of villi per field, respectively. Regarding the morphometrical analysis significant differences were observed, in the jejunum villi height sampling by the methods Swiss roll (1,157.66 ± 148.25 µm, p= 0.0015) that showed the highest mean. Deeper crypt depths were observed in the jejunum (156.59 ± 15.68 µm, p= 0.0002) and ileum (131.13 ± 15.01 µm, p= 0.0006) collect by the Swiss roll method. An interaction between the bouin fixative was also observed in the jejunum (p= 0.0223) for this variable. Duodenum sampling by transversal section (12.68 ± 1.45 µm, p= 0.0076) was the only segment that had a significant difference for villi:crypt ratio, showing the highest mean. It can be concluded that the Swiss roll technique was the best method for morphometrical evaluation of the chickens’ intestines, since the highest counts of villi per field and viable villi per field were obtained, while buffered formalin was considered as the best fixative.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42061/30056,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Frequency of pathogens in routine bacteriological diagnosis in fish and their antimicrobial resistance,"Aquaculture is one of the sectors of animal husbandry with the fastest growth rate. However, the increase in the sector's production chain without proper management can result in factors that favor the development of diseases, especially infectious diseases caused by bacteria. Many factors, such as agriculture or industry resides, improper use of antibiotics in animals or humans, have contributed to increased environmental pressure and the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, while residues from these drugs can remain in the carcasses and in water a risk to public and environmental health. From that, we identified the bacterial genus/species and their bacterial resistance to antibiotics from samples received from fish disease outbreaks for bacteriosis diagnosis between January 2017 and October 2020. Isolated bacteria were subjected to the Kirby and Bauer sensitivity test for five classes of antibiotics (penicillins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, amphenicols, and tetracyclines). Of the 181 analyzed outbreaks, 232 bacteria were isolated, including Streptococcus spp., Aeromonas spp., Edwardsiella spp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chromobacterium violaceum, Flavobacterium spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Vibrio spp., Enterobacter spp., Chryseobacterium meningosepticum. Of the 232 bacteria, 40 strains were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR), with Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas spp., and Edwardsiella spp. representing more than half of this number (22/total). With several bacteria demonstrating resistance to Brazilian aquaculture-legalized drugs (tetracycline and florfenicol), it is mandatory to research, not only for alternatives to the use of antibiotics, but also for other drugs effective against the main circulating bacterial pathogens. In addition, vigilance over the occurrence of resistant bacteria is necessary, considering the appearance of zoonotic bacteria with multi-resistant characteristics, becoming a public health concern.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42196/30113,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Laboratory profile of malnutrition in hospitalized dogs,"Malnutrition occurs when the supply of available nutrients is less than organic demand. It is an underdiagnosed problem in veterinary medicine and can result in several negative metabolic consequences, with greater morbidity and mortality. Currently, the classification of nutritional status (NS) is performed subjectively in veterinary medicine, so studies and discoveries about laboratory markers (objectives) of malnutrition are desirable. This study evaluated the correlations between several laboratory variables (practical and low-cost measurements) and the nutritional status (NS) of 246 dogs from a veterinary school hospital in southern Brazil. In this way, the laboratory profile of malnutrition in this population is evident. NS was classified by body condition score (BCS) and muscle mass score (MMS). A patient was considered to be malnourished if the BCS was less than 3 (values from 1 to 9). The laboratory variables analyzed were hemogram, cholesterol, total protein (TP), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), CRP/albumin ratio, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin (TF), transferrin saturation index (TSI), and transthyretin. The means and standard deviations of the variables, correlation analyses, and comparative analyses (Kruskal-Wallis in alfa = 5%) were calculated. This research aimed to identify objective and practical malnutrition markers that help in the elaboration of a protocol for nutritional evaluation in diseased dogs. Low values of TF, TIBC, TP, hemogram, and TSI elevation were indicative of malnutrition. Additionally, cholesterol and albuminemia are not good markers of malnutrition in dogs with systemic diseases. For the graduation of the inflammatory state (important to differentiate inflammatory hypoproteinemia from protein malnutrition), it is more reliable to measure the CRP/albumin ratio. Canine transthyretin cannot be measured with reagents designed for humans, such as those used in this study. It was possible to conclude that laboratory indicators of malnutrition in sick dogs include low values of TF, TIBC, and TP, anemia, and elevations of TSI.

2021,42,Immune response in Santa Inês sheep during Fasciola hepatica infection,"In the present study, we describe the proliferative response and the IFN - y, IL-10, IL-4 cytokine expression profiles in peripheral blood, and IgG production, after the experimental infection of Santa Inês sheep with 250 Fasciola hepatica metacercariae that were evaluated at 60 and 210 days post-infection(dpi). The cytokine expression profile at 60 dpi was characterized by the production of IFN - y, and IL-10, which is indicative of an initial mixed Th1/Th2 response. The modulation of the response occurred at 210 dpi with a predominance of IL-10 and IL-4 over IFN - y. Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood stimulated with F. hepatica antigen exhibited proliferative capacity at 60 dpi, whereas the response was consistent with modulation from Th1 to Th2 in the chronic phase. The IgG antibody response was more marked at 60 days than at 210 dpi, confirming the mixed-response profile. The late modulation of the T lymphocyte response in association with the predominance of IL-10 and IL-4 at 210 dpi suggests the involvement of these cytokines after the establishment of the parasites in the bile ducts. The transition from a mixed to a regulatory response in the chronic phase was also accompanied by a reduced number of eggs per gram of feces.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42878/30059,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Feline obesity: risk factors and clinical and metabolic findings,"Excess body fat can cause a series of metabolic and mechanical effects on the body. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the clinical, metabolic, and risk factors of overweight (OW) cats. For the acceptance of participation in the research, the tutors were asked to answer a questionnaire containing 34 questions and to point out the body condition score (BCS) on a sheet containing nine images of different scores (1 to 9 on a 9-point scale). Thereafter, the body evaluations were performed as a classification of the BCS on a scale from 1 to 9, with an ideal score (IS) of BCS 5 and OW for BCS > 5. Further, the lean mass index and morphometric measurements (thoracic and abdominal circumferences and height and length of the patella to calcaneal tuberosity) were performed to estimate the percentage of body fat. Systolic blood pressure was measured using the non-invasive Doppler method and blood was collected for hemogram and serum biochemistry (creatinine, urea, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol). After these analyses, we sought to guide and raise the awareness of the tutors to promote the correct nutritional and environmental management of the animals. Thirty adult cats were divided into two groups, based on the classification of the BCS, with eight having an IS and 22 being OW. The OW group was found to have a low level of physical activity, hypercholesterolemia, and higher values of body characteristics. Additionally, there was a median agreement between the perceptions of the clinician and the tutors. Therefore, it was concluded that the main laboratory alteration found in the obese cats was hypercholesterolemia, which was a critical parameter. It was observed that a low degree of physical activity could cause excess weight gain. It was found that the guardians of the cats with ideal weight underestimated the BCS, which could contribute to the supply of excess food and consequently, obesity. Thus, this study was sought to guide and raise the awareness of tutors, to promote the correct nutritional and environmental management thereby providing welfare and quality of life to the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43112/30060,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Comparative analysis of the hormone production and gene expression profiles in ovine uterus tissue during oestrus cycle synchronized using medroxyprogesterone acetate plus eCG and prostaglandin analogue,"The combination of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and gonadotropin chorionic (eCG) has been widely used to synchronize oestrus cycle in sheep, but their effects on the gene expression in uterine tissue are yet to be elucidated. To evaluate the effect of MPA + eCG or prostaglandin analogue (PA) treatments on the rate of oestrus cycle synchronization, as well as further hormone production and gene expression profiles in uterine tissue, 14 Santa Inês ewes were randomly selected. The MPA + eCG group (n = 7) received intravaginal insertion of MPA-impregnated sponges for 14 days and was administered 350 IU eCG on the day of sponge withdrawal. The PA group (n = 7) was administered two doses of 100 ug of PA separated by 12 days. The ewes were assessed for the rate of oestrus cycle synchronization and the serum concentrations of progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). Additionally, the expression of estrogen receptor (ERalfa), progesterone receptor (P4R), and immunolocalization of interferon receptor (IFNAR1) in the uterine tissue samples collected 15 th day post-mating were examined. The rate of oestrus cycle synchronization was 100% (n=7/7) and 57.14% (n=4/7) in the MPA + eCG and PA groups, respectively. Moreover, the MPA + eCG group exhibited higher serum concentration of P4 than the PA group (p smaller 0.05). However, the E2 serum concentration did not differ between the two groups (p larger 0.05). The relative expression of P4R and ERalfa mRNA analyzed using real-time PCR and immunodetection of IFNAR1 were similar between the two groups tested (p larger 0.05). Conclusively, MPA + eCG treatment improved the rate of oestrus cycle synchronization and endogenous P4 production; however, it did not affect the expression of sex steroid receptors and IFNAR1 in uterine ovine tissue.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43115/30061,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effect of bentonite on the health and dairy production of cows submitted to a diet naturally contaminated by mycotoxins,"Mycotoxins often contaminate cattle food, which can cause liver damage, immunosuppression, and reduced milk production. Although previous studies have shown the benefits of adsorbents in farm animals, knowledge regarding their mechanism of action is limited, especially when intoxication occurs due to naturally contaminated diets. The present study aimed to assess whether the daily oral administration of mycotoxin adsorbent bentonite clay based on aluminosilicate for 56 days, would attenuate these changes in 18 dairy cows, which were multiparous in the middle of the lactation stage, and were consuming a diet containing fumonisin B1 and B2, zearalenone, and desoxynivalenol. The animals were divided into treatment (TG, n = 9) and control (CG, n = 9) groups, and subjected to assessment of liver functions, hematological assessments, assessment of oxidative leucocyte metabolism by the tetrazolium nitroazul (NBT) technique, and physical chemical analysis of milk, every week for two months, totaling eight analyses. It was observed that the use of the adsorbent caused a reduction in the milk excretion of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), an increase in levels of serum protein (p = 0.03) and albumin (p = 0.0001), an increase in leukocyte oxidative metabolism from day 24 of treatment(p = 0.05), and increased milk production from the day 16 of treatment (p = 0.08). There was no improvement in the physicochemical indices of the milk. It was concluded that the use of an aluminosilicate-based adsorbent was able to attenuate the effects of mycotoxins on the function of leukocytes and increase milk production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43509/30062,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Economic impacts of Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 infection in Brazil: Meta-analysis based on epidemiological indicators,"This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to estimate the economic impact of Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoAHV1) infection in Brazil using epidemiological indicators through a meta-analysis. Specific descriptors were used to retrieve studies from the Scopus, PubMed, Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Teses e Dissertações, and Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações da Capes databases, selecting those that met the inclusion criteria established between the years 2000 and 2020. The selected studies were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis using prevalence data as the primary outcome with a 95% confidence interval (CI) with a meta-analysis of random effects and measures of heterogeneity, significance, magnitude of the effect, and measurement of publication bias. Abortion costs and estimates were calculated based on the prevalence of BoAHV1 infection in Brazil and the characteristics of the agent as viral subtypes that cause abortion, period of occurrence, average pregnancy rate, and morbidity applied to susceptible animals and animal replacement values. The results were obtained from 49 studies included for meta-analysis where a prevalence of BoAHV1 infection of 54.12% (95% CI: 49.07% - 59.26%) in the bovine population and 88.53% (95% CI: 82.97%–92.43%) was present. From the structured formula, it is estimated that 258,779 bovine abortions occur, which causes a total loss, based only on the occurrence of abortion, of US $ 48,402,244.00 to the country. It is noteworthy that because of the losses caused, strict control and eradication measures need to be implemented based on the elaboration of normative instruction that includes health education measures, vaccination, tests for traffic, and animal trade so that BoAHV1 infections do not continue to negatively impact national producers economically, productively, and socially.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/43520/30063,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"How canopy structural and morphological characteristics, and forage chemical composition affect a pasture-based dairy system?","Pasture-based systems are prevalent among small-scale family farms. Many farmers consider that the nutritional value of the plant is more relevant than the canopy structure. This study aimed to analyze the various factors related to plant structure and chemical composition that most influence milk yield per hectare under rotational stocking. The experiment was performed at the Animal Husbandry Experimental Station of the Extreme South of Bahia. Three rotational stocking systems with three forage species [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. cv. Tifton 85, Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf. cv. Xaraés, and Megathyrsus maximus Jacq. cv. Mombasa] were evaluated. Nine crossbred Holstein x Gyr cows were allocated to a balanced 3 x 3 Latin square design. The cows were rotated in three pastures every 14 days. The experimental period consisted of seven evaluation cycles of 42 days each. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and multivariate linear regression were the statistical techniques used to evaluate plant structure and morphological characteristics, and animal performance. Xaraés palisadegrass and Mombasa guinea grass were similar for all evaluated characteristics (P > 0.05), whereas Tifton 85 was different from them in terms of structural, morphological, and chemical composition characteristics (P < 0.05). In the PCA, 59.1% of the total variance was explained by components 1 and 2 for the structural and morphological characteristics, and forage chemical composition. Forage structural and morphological variables showed better results in the multivariate linear regression analysis for milk yield per hectare. Structural and morphological characteristics were more correlated with Mombasa guinea grass than Xaraés palisadegrass and Tifton 85. The structural and morphological characteristics of forages were the main factors determining milk yield per hectare in exclusively pasture-based systems with animals of low production.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41659/30064,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,In vitro ruminal fermentation kinetics of diets with crambe cake protein replacing soybean meal protein by gas production technique,"The objective of this study was to evaluate ingredients and diets containing increasing levels of crambe cake protein replacing soybean meal protein, with in vitro ruminal fermentation parameters using a gas production technique. Diets were formulated for feedlot lambs and contained different levels of crambe cake protein (0, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 g kg-1) replacing soybean meal protein. Corn silage was used as roughage. Carbohydrate digestion rates were estimated using the in vitro gas production technique and the cumulative gas production kinetics were analyzed using the bicompartmental logistic model. The parameters values of ruminal degradation kinetics were generated using the R statistical program with the Gauss-Newton algorithm and then subjected to analysis of variance and regression (when necessary) according to a completely randomized experimental design with five treatments and five replications. Upon carbohydrate fractionation of ingredients and experimental diets, it was observed that corn grain and corn silage presented the highest levels of total carbohydrates (TC), with values of 128.3 and 464.8 g kg-1 dry matter (DM) in fraction B2, respectively. Lower TC content was found for soybean meal and crambe cake (CC). There was a predominance of fractions A + B1 in the ingredients and experimental diets. The B2 fraction decreased in the diets with the inclusion of the CC protein, and CC presented the highest C fraction. Protein fractionation (g kg-1 DM and g kg-1 crude protein - CP), the ingredients and diets showed a higher proportion of fractions A and B1 + B2. In in vitro degradation, the diet without CC (0 g kg-1 DM) showed the highest final cumulative gas production (365.04 mL g-1 of incubated DM), while the CC presented the lowest volume (166.68 mL g-1 of incubated DM). The gas volume of non-fibrous carbohydrate fermentation and fibrous carbohydrate degradation rate exhibited a quadratic effect according increasing levels of CC (Pmax = 265.8 g kg-1 DM and Pmin = 376.3 g kg-1 DM, respectively). The lag time and final gas volume showed a decreasing linear effect with increasing levels of CC protein. The degradation rate of non-fibrous carbohydrates and the final volume of fibrous carbohydrates did not differ. Replacing soybean meal protein with CC protein at the level of 250 g kg-1 of dry matter in diets formulated for feedlot lambs leads to good profiles of ruminal fermentation kinetics with respect to the degradation of fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42201/30293,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Marandu) under continuous grazing in the first year of implementation of pasture and after second year of the eucalyptus planting in an Integrated Crop-Livestock System and Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest, which were tested in the four seasons. The experimental design was in random blocks, with three treatments: Crop-Livestock System (ICL) and Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest with two eucalyptus tree densities (ICLF-1L, 196 eucalyptus trees ha-1 and ICLF-3L, 448 eucalyptus trees ha-1) and four replicates. Sixty castrated Nellore cattle with initial weight of 235.43 ± 25.46 kg and mean age of 16 ± 2.81 months were used during the growing phase under continuous grazing. The agronomic variables were: total dry mass of forage, leaves, stem and dead material; leaf:stem and live:senescent material ratios; and accumulation rate. The leaf:stem and live: senescent material relation did not obtain any difference between the evaluated systems. Dry matter, crude protein, fiber fractions and digestibility of leaf blades were evaluated. Dry mass of the forage (6775 kg ha-1), stem (2175 kg ha-1), senescent material (3175 kg ha-1) and dry matter content (28.6%) were greater in the ICL, whereas crude protein (11.3%) was greater in the ICLFs. On the other hand, accumulation rate and dry mass of leaf blades did not change between systems. Thus, until the first year of grazing, tree systems have advantages, because the forage production (accumulation rate) and leaf mass are similar to those of plants in full sun, besides showing higher nutritional value.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42812/30066,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Factors associated with grain feeding in dairy farms located in the central-western region of Paraná State, Brazil","This study aimed to investigate factors associated with grain feeding and determine the typology of dairy farms that use high-grain diets. Twenty-two farm operators were interviewed in three municipalities located in the central-western region of Paraná state, Brazil. Information on reproductive and nutritional management practices, sociodemographic characteristics, and farm performance was collected. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multiple linear regression. Three factors (F1, F2, and F3) were extracted, which together explained 82.61% of the total variance. F1 comprised diet quality, technology, and breeding composition. F2 comprised labor and size. F3 comprised feed quality and schooling. Farms were classified into four groups and compared in terms of factor scores and performance parameters. Group 1 had the highest mean score on F1 (0.715), group 4 on F2 (1.642), and group 2 on F3 (1.116). Groups 4 and 1 had the highest milk productivity (2043.50 and 399.52 L day-1, respectively) and labor efficiency (418.16 and 148.63 L worker-1 day-1, respectively). Group 4 also had the highest mean number of cows per worker (25.52 cows worker-1). Regression analysis revealed that diet quality, technology, and breeding composition (F1) explained the variance in cow productivity. Labor and size, (F2) explained the variance in number of cows per worker. Daily productivity and labor efficiency were explained by both F1 and F2. Feed quality and farm operator’s level of schooling did not explain the variation in any of the variables. We found that roughage quality, breeding technology, and herd breed composition are the major factors associated with grain feeding. Farmers who feed cows high-quality roughage throughout the year and invest in genetic improvement and selective breeding strategies are more likely to adopt high-grain feeding and have high milk productivity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42835/30067,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Relationship between metabolic profile, diseases, productive and reproductive performance in high- producing Holstein cows in the postpartum period","The present study aimed to monitor Holstein cows in the postpartum period, and to evaluate the occurrence of clinical diseases and their relationship with metabolic profile, milk yield and composition, and reproductive performance. One hundred and five Holstein cows, 32 primiparous and 73 multiparous, from two dairy herds in Arapoti, Paraná State, were clinically monitored up to ten days after calving. The clinical occurrences diagnosed were: dystocia, metritis, retained placenta, clinical hypocalcemia, displaced abomasum, mastitis, pneumonia, and digital dermatitis. Blood samples were collected at one, two, five, and ten days postpartum for analysis of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and total calcium. Individual milk yield was measured up to 100 days in milk (DIM), and the first test-day was evaluated for milk composition. Statistical analyses were conducted using the MIXED procedure of SAS, and the fixed effects of farm (A and B), parity (primiparous and multiparous), and occurrence of clinical diseases (sick and healthy cows) were included. Forty-eight cows (45.7%) had one or more clinical occurrences. In these sick cows, the BHB concentration at five DIM was higher (P = 0.06) than in healthy cows; 0.78 and 0.57 mmol L-1, respectively. Regarding milk yield, cows with one or more clinical occurrences had lower (P < 0.01) daily milk yield up to 30 DIM, and had a tendency of lower (P = 0.09) accumulated production up to 100 DIM than healthy cows. Sick cows had a tendency to show lower (P = 0.08) milk total solids content than healthy cows; 12.04 and 12.60%, respectively. There were no significant differences between sick and healthy animals in the remaining milk components, or the reproductive parameters assessed.

2021,42,Yield and nutritional value of biomass sorghum (BRS 716) managed in different row spacing and maturity at harvest in the semiarid region of Brazil,"The objective was to evaluate the structural, yield and nutritional characteristics of biomass sorghum BRS 716 managed in different row planting spacing and harvest age in a semiarid region of Brazil. Three row spacing (45, 70 and 90 cm; plots) and four maturity at harvest (70, 100, 130 and 160 days; subplots) were evaluated following a randomized block design in a 3 x 4 split plot arrangement, with eight blocks. The useful area was 3 x 15 m. Variation in soil fertility in the area was the blocking factor. There was interaction between row spacing and maturity at harvest (P < 0.05) on plant height (P = 0.01), dry matter yield (DMY; P < 0.01) and proportion of senescent material (P = 0.01). The DMY observed at the age of 160 days and spacing of 90 cm was 41.40% higher than the DMY at the same age and in spacings of 45 and 70 cm (mean of 21.45 t/ha). As the maturity at harvest increased, there was a reduction in the crude protein content (P < 0.01), potential degradability (P < 0.01) and effective degradability (P < 0.01) of dry matter, and the content of non-fiber carbohydrates (P < 0.01), total digestible nutrients (P < 0.01) and the readily soluble fraction (P < 0.01) of the dry matter increased.

The treatments consisted of corn kernels (Zea mays) ground through a 3-mm sieve and rehydrated with chlorine-free water or unsalted whey (NaCl) combined or not with bacterial-enzymatic inoculant. This was a 2 x 2 factorial completely randomized design with sources of rehydration (water or whey) and absence and presence of bacterial-enzymatic inoculant with eight replications. Water and acid whey were added to ground corn with 12% moisture in order to increase it to 35%. Rehydrated corn was ensiled in Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) minisilos and stored for 60 d. The bacterial-enzymatic inoculant used was composed of Lactobacillus curvatus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. buchneri, L. lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Propionibacterium acidipropionici and Enterococcus faecium, in concentrations of 1010 CFU g-1 and 5% cellulose-based enzyme complex. The aerobic exposure of silages was evaluated for 120 hours. There was interaction (P = 0.02) between the sources of rehydration and the use or not of the inoculant on the values of silage temperature during aerobic exposure. There was a difference for dry matter (DM) losses (P=0.38) between rehydrated corn silages with and without inoculant. DM losses were 37.51% higher in silage without inoculant compared to silage with inoculant (3.84% DM). There was no difference between the sources of rehydration on DM losses (P = 0.39), with a mean value of 4.99%. Corn rehydration using acid whey (P < 0.01) increased 2.19% and 31.36% DM and ash content compared to water, an average of 66.14% and 1.28%, respectively. There was no interaction (P = 0.30) between the sources of rehydration and the use of inoculants on the in vitro digestibility of DM (mean of 79.26%).

2021,42,"High seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora spp. in stray dogs from Rolim de Moura, Rondônia state, Western Brazilian Amazon","Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora spp. are important apicomplexan pathogens that can infect dogs and result in a neurological syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of T. gondii and Neospora spp. in stray dogs in the state of Rondônia, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2014 to April 2016. A total of 458 dogs blood samples were collected at the Center for Control of Zoonosis (CCZ), and anti-T. gondii and anti-N. spp. antibody levels were detected and measured using indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The seroprevalence of T. gondii and Neospora spp. in dogs it was 82.20% and 73.85%, respectively. The seroprevalence of coinfections was 47.59%. This is the first report of anti-T. gondii and anti-Neospora spp. antibodies detected in stray dogs in Rolim de Moura, state of Rondônia, Western Brazilian Amazon. Male dogs showed a higher frequency of anti-T. gondii antibodies than female dogs (88.0% vs. 75.3%; p smaller 0.001), presenting 2.41 times more chances of having the disease. High seroprevalence of infection (92.4%: T. gondii and 89.2%: Neospora spp.) was detected in the group bigger, smaller 1-year-old dogs, in all collections, with OR 7.35 and OR 10.27 for the presence of anti-T. gondii and anti-Neospora spp., respectively.

2021,42,Edaphic entomofauna associated with coconut crops in the eastern Amazon,"In the Eastern Amazon is the largest continuous coconut crop area in the world. This region is known for its high precipitation levels and an ecosystem of extensive insect biodiversity. It is important to know the local entomofauna and to know whether there is a balance between the different insect groups. This study aimed to understand the influence of seasonality on the dynamics of edaphic insect families, comparing the environment as a whole and in different commercial coconut crop areas and riparian forests in the Eastern Amazon. Forty pitfall traps were installed in the ground at an average distance of 1 m from the coconut stipe. They were filled with 200 ml of an aqueous solution of liquid neutral soap and 70% alcohol. Traps were installed in eight areas: an area of riparian forest (A1) and seven in commercial coconut crop areas (A2 to A8), in the Amazon dry and rainy season. The similarity between the insects was measured using Euclidean distance. The abundance of families in each collection area used qualitative similarity. For family dominance, quantitative similarity was used. Diversity analyses were performed to justify the similarities of the clusters through the Shannon and Simpson Indices. In total, 252,313 individuals, 118 families, and 9 orders were collected. There were many Formicidae in both climatic periods because it is a social insect and has edaphic habits. The families with the most individuals in the collections were Drosophilidae, Staphylinidae, Bostrichidae, Phoridae, Nitidulidae, Scolytidae, Tenebrionidae, Scarabaeidae, Ceratopogomidae, and Platyogastridae. The riparian forest area (A1) showed the greatest diversity and least dominance. The oldest cultivated areas A2 and A3 (7 years) showed the greatest diversity in the dry season. In the rainy season, the most diversified areas were those with the highest land slope (A6 and A7). The most dominant areas were A5 and A8, where the largest number of Solenopsis spp. were found. This study showed the importance of obtaining basic information about coconut entomofauna and conducting research on insect dynamics in agricultural crops in the Amazon region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40400/29969,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Mixture compatibility of ChinNPV baculovirus with herbicides and fungicides used in soybean,"Chrysodeixis includens Walker, 1858 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), commonly known as soybean looper, is one of the main pests that reduces soybean yield due to its defoliation capacity. Population outbreaks of this pest can occur in the vegetative stage of the crop, together with the occurrence of weeds or in the reproductive stage, at the same time as that of diseases. This often requires the use of pesticides against pests and weeds, or fungi at the same time. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the compatibility of baculovirus ChinNPV with different synthetic chemical herbicides and fungicides used in soybean. Four bioassays were carried out, with or without the addition of ChinNPV to different herbicides and fungicides. The artificial diets were immersed in the solutions of the pesticides and their mixture and supplied to the caterpillars of C. includens, immediately and after one and two hours of mixing. The evaluation was performed by quantifying the number of dead caterpillars. The results showed that the ChinNPV baculovirus is compatible for mixing with all studied herbicides and fungicides, even after two hours of mixing. In all the studied scenarios, baculovirus mixed with chemical pesticides triggered the same mortality as sprayed with baculovirus alone, and values of over 80% mortality of C. includens have always been recorded.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41074/29947,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Physiological potential of Dyckia spp. bromeliad seeds under different temperatures,"Bromeliads have been gaining ground in the economic scenario due mainly to their use as ornamental plants. Bromeliads of the genus Dyckia exhibit different morphologies, and therefore, have relevance in this market. However, some species are threatened due to the extraction of plants from their natural environments. Many of these species are endemic and native to Brazil and there are few studies on their seed physiology; hence, expansion of research into this topic is essential. An alternative for the preservation of such plants is the production of seedlings using seeds. To this end, the objective of this work was to evaluate the physiological potential of seeds of Dyckia brevifolia, Dyckia beateae, and Dyckia excelsa at different temperatures, and determine the number of days to carry out the tests. A completely randomized design was adopted, with three species of Dyckia, analyzed separately, and four temperatures (20, 25, 30, and 35 °C). The following were evaluated: first germination count, germination, germination speed index, length of seedling, and seedling dry weight. The data were analyzed using the Sisvar software for normality and homogeneity, and when the assumptions were met, they were subjected to analysis of variance using the F test (p < 0.05) and the means were compared using the Tukey test at 5% probability. Seeds of D. excelsa emit the radicle more quickly at 20 and 35 °C; however, temperatures of 25 and 30 °C provide better conditions for seedling growth and development. The greatest vigor of D. brevifolia seeds is observed at temperatures of 30 and 35 °C. Seeds of D. beateae emit the radicle more quickly at 20 °C, and the largest seedlings are observed at 35 °C. The first germination count of D. brevifolia, D. beateae, and D. excelsa should be evaluated on the third day after sowing. The germination evaluations for D. excelsa and D. beateae should be carried out on the ninth day after sowing, and those for D. brevifolia on the sixth day after sowing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41186/29901,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Plant density and nitrogen topdressing of high-altitude main-season corn,"An appropriate combination of plant density with nitrogen (N) fertilization can optimize corn growth and increase grain yields. This study evaluated the effects of nitrogen topdressing rates and plant density levels on the agronomic performance of corn. The early hybrid DKB 240 YG, with high yield potential and stability, was evaluated in two summer crops in Mauá da Serra, Paraná (950 m asl), in a Cfb climate, on a Rhodic Eutrudox. The experiment was arranged in randomized complete blocks and subdivided plots with four replications. The plant densities (60,000; 75,000; 90,000 and 105,000 plants ha-1) were assessed in the plots and the nitrogen (ammonium nitrate 32% N) topdressing rates (0, 60, 120, 180 and 240 kg ha-1) in the subplots. The stem diameter, plant height, ear insertion height and grain yield were evaluated. The stem diameter, plant height, ear insertion height and grain yield were influenced by the interaction between plant density and nitrogen topdressing under the tested high-altitude edaphoclimatic conditions. The stem diameter of corn plants decreased due to the increase in plant density whereas nitrogen topdressing attenuated this reduction. Maximum plant height was observed at a density of 75,000 plants ha-1 associated with a topdressing of 169 kg ha-1 of N, and highest ear insertion at 60,000 plants ha-1 and 168 kg ha-1 of N. Corn yield was highest at a density of 105,000 plants ha-1 associated with a topdressing of 185 kg N ha-1 of N.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41202/29902,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Parasitism and behavioral responses of Acromyrmex coronatus (Fabricius, 1804) and Acromyrmex crassispinus (Forel, 1909) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) to Myrmosicarius catharinensis","Leaf-cutting ants of the genus Acromyrmex cause serious damage to cultivated forest areas. Some flies of the family Phoridae are known to parasitize them, and the result of this interaction can provide a promising basis for the management of these ants. This study was developed to record the parasitism and behavioral responses of Acromyrmex spp. leaf-cutting ants to parasitoid phorids in the municipality of Londrina-PR, Brazil. Visual examinations and collections of leaf-cutting ants and associated phorids were carried out between October/2019 and April/2020 in selected anthills and their trails, located on the campus of the State University of Londrina (UEL) and at the Botanical Garden of Londrina. The collected insects were preserved in 70% alcohol, for later identification of the species. The behavioral response of the ants to the parasitoids was recorded individually and collectively, following protocols cited in the literature. The frequencies of the different response behaviors exhibited by the attacked ants were compared using analysis of variance. The leaf-cutting ant species Acromyrmex coronatus and Acromyrmex crassispinus were found at the two evaluated sites. Myrmosicarius catharinensis was the only species of parasitoid phorid found, which attacked both ant species. Although the occurrence of M. catharinensis has been reported in other Brazilian states and its association with A. crassispinus recorded in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this is the first report of the occurrence of the phorid in the state of Paraná with a new association for the species A. coronatus. Under foraging action by the parasitoid, 63.5% of the ants exhibited only one behavioral response, while 36.5% showed two. Accelerated walking, attempting to ""bite"" the parasitoid, and adopting a 'C' posture were the most frequent behavioral responses to avoid parasitism. Ants crowding together around a worker and the presence of ""hitchhiker"" workers on the transported leaf fragments were the observed changes in collective behavior, the latter being the most frequent. These changes occurred in all observed ant nests and, in two of them, the constancy of alteration in collective behavior was 53%. These results demonstrate the interference caused in nests of Acromyrmex spp. by the occurrence of M. catharinensis, a potential control agent for this pest.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41632/29967,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Biochemical changes in black oat plants in response to water deficit under different temperatures,"The black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) stands out as a forage of great importance in Brazilian agriculture. However, the productivity and quality of this forage can be affected by abiotic factors, such as temperature and water availability, which affect the physiological processes and facilitate the accumulation of free radicals (reactive oxygen species - ROS). Thus, the objective of this study was to understand the biochemical changes in black oat plants subjected to water deficit at different temperatures. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse in two experimental periods, which presented an average temperature of 20 °C and 24 °C, respectively. Black oat seeds, of the variety IAPAR 61, were sown in pots and the plants were irrigated for 60 days. After which, the pots were covered with plastic bags and the irrigation was suspended. The analyses were carried out in five periods of evaluation - M1: plants before the suspension of irrigation, M2: plants at the first wilting point, M3: three days after plastic removal and irrigation return, M4: four days after M3 and before the second suspension of irrigation, and M5: the second wilting point. The levels of total protein and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), were analyzed. The experimental design was completely randomized, with six replications, in a factorial scheme of average temperature × water management × periods of evaluation, and the means were compared by Tukey’s test at 5%. In response to water deficiency and temperature increase, black oat plants increased their levels of total soluble proteins, and there was greater lipid peroxidation due to the increase in malondialdehyde content. There was no change in the activity of the enzymes catalase and ascorbate peroxidase under water deficit, and these activities decreased with increasing temperature.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41678/29904,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Bokashi, simple superphosphate, and fertigation for the growth and nutrition of hybrid Cattleya (Orchidaceae)","Potted flower production is an important floricultural activity. However, there have been few studies on the fertilization management of orchids. Fertigation with urea and potassium chloride is feasible, but little information is available regarding the interaction of these fertilizers with other sources of nutrients. Thus, the present study evaluated the effects of application of bokashi and a simple superphosphate and their interactions with fertigation on the growth and nutrition of hybrid Cattleya. Seedlings of Laeliocattleya Drumbeat × Laeliocattleya Gold Digger hybrid were submitted to two ferti-irrigation levels (absent and present) using urea and potassium chloride as nitrogen and potassium sources, respectively. As complementary fertilization, bokashi and superphosphate were applied singly and in combination. A commercial fertilizer (Peters®) was used as an additional control. Fertigation increased plant height; leaf area; number, length, and diameter of pseudobulbs; dry mass of leaves, pseudobulbs, and roots; and content of chlorophyll, carotenoid, and nitrogen. The application of bokashi resulted in dry mass gain in all plant organs. The combination of fertigation and bokashi was superior to the commercial fertilizer in terms of increased leaf area, chlorophyll A content, carotenoid content, and dry mass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41706/29951,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Genetic divergence based on leaf vegetative and anatomical traits of Coffea canephora clones,"Knowledge of the expression of traits associated with drought tolerance is important to mitigate impacts on coffee production in a climate change scenario. This study aimed to understand the genetic divergence between Coffea canephora genotypes grown in the Western Amazon based on leaf vegetative and anatomical traits. For this, fifteen high-performance genotypes were evaluated in a randomized block design with five replications of one plant per plot to analyze three leaf vegetative traits (leaf area index, root volume, and total dry mass) and five leaf anatomical traits (polar and equatorial diameter, density and number of stomata, and stomatal area). The data were interpreted using analysis of variance and the Scott-Knott mean cluster test (p bigger, smaller 0.05). The Tocher optimization method and principal component analysis with reference points were used to quantify the genetic divergence. Tocher clustering separated the fifteen clones into five groups, and the scatter in the plane into three groups. Stomatal density was the trait that most contributed to the dissimilarity between genotypes with the potential to be used in future studies for the selection of water deficit-tolerant genotypes. The BRS 3213 genotype showed the greatest genetic dissimilarity and composed a group isolated from the other genotypes in terms of anatomical characteristics. Hybrids 12 and 15 have leaf anatomical traits with higher drought tolerance potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41989/29966,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Optimizing the rate of phosphorus to enhance grain yield and quality in two Camelina sativa (L.) crantz accessions,"Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is an emerging oil seed crop and research information on its response to different levels of phosphorous (P) fertilizer is lacking. The two years study was performed to investigate the response of C. sativa to various rates of P fertilizer. The experiments were laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement having four replications. The P was applied in soil at the rate of 0, 30, 40 and 60 kg ha-1 to two C. sativa accessions namely Canadian and Australian. Soil applied phosphorus rates had significant effects on the growth, yield and quality of C. sativa and two accessions were varied to each other. Australian accession performed better in terms of quality traits and Canadian was superior in terms of seed yield. An increase in P rate improved growth, yield and quality and 60 kg P ha-1 resulted in maximal crop growth rate (6.79), seed yield (1239 kg ha-1), total P uptake (0.67%) and oil contents (39.8%). The regression model estimated that each increment in P rate increased the seed yield by 11.5 and 11.2 kg ha-1 in Canadian and Australian accessions, respectively. Conclusively, increases in P rates (0 to 60 kg ha-1) impart a positive impact on C. sativa accessions and 60 kg P ha-1 was most effective to achieve optimum yield and profitability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42197/29958,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Attenuation of salt stress on the physiology and production of bell peppers by treatment with salicylic acid,"The use of saline water for irrigation in semi-arid regions has become a reality due to the water scarcity that occurs in most of the year. In this scenario, exogenous application of salicylic acid may be a strategy to mitigate the deleterious effects of salt stress on plants and ensure the production of socioeconomically important crops in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil, such as bell pepper. Thus, this study examines the osmoprotective effect of salicylic acid on gas exchanges, chloroplast pigments and production components of 'All Big' bell pepper plants irrigated with water with different saline levels. The experiment was carried out in greenhouse conditions in Campina Grande - PB, Brazil. Treatments consisted of four levels of electrical conductivity on the irrigation water (0.8, 1.6, 2.4 and 3.2 dS m-1) and four concentrations of salicylic acid (0, 1.2, 2.4 and 3.6 mM), which were distributed in a 4 × 4 factorial arrangement in a randomized block design with three replicates. Increases in irrigation water salinity from 0.8 dS m-1 resulted in changes in gas exchange and total chlorophyll levels of 'All Big' bell pepper plants. The estimated salicylic acid concentration of 1.7 mM reduced the effects of salinity on stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency, total chlorophyll and fruit diameters. Irrigation with water of 1.8, 0.8 and 1.6 dS m-1 salinity associated with the estimated salicylic acid concentration of 1.6 mM increased the biosynthesis of chlorophylls a and b and the number of fruits, respectively, in bell pepper plants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42093/29908,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Chemical thinning increasing larger fruits and profit in red guava orchards,"The guava is a fruit of strong economic and social relevance, regionally projected and greatly important in some regions of Brazil. The chemical thinning has been adopted in some fruit trees to obtain greater caliber of fruits and better prices. However, some aspects still need to be investigated for the safe and economical viability use of such technique. This research aimed to evaluate the chemical thinning efficiency, production and commercial classification of guava fruits cv. Paluma and provide an economic analysis of this crop system. The ethephon and benzyladenine were applied to fruits with an average size of 18 mm at 0, 150, 300 and 450 mg L-1. The replicated trial in two crop cycles was in randomized block design in a factorial arrangement 2x4. The economic analysis was calculated through total production operational cost, in order to determine gross revenue, operating profit, profitability index, equilibrium price and yield. The benzyladenine and ethephon promoted the highest percentage of thinning fruits at 450 mg L-1, with averages of 67.6% and 70.0%, respectively. However, benzyladenine had a phytotoxic effect when applied at highest concentrations, 300 and 450 mg L-1, respectively. The ethephon enabled greater production of larger caliber fruits in the highest concentration (450 mg L-1).  Chemical thinning reduced total operational cost and increased operating profit by 7.57%, as compared to hand thinning.  Results also presented that chemical fruit thinning provided equilibrium yield of 4.98 t ha-1 for ‘Paluma’ guava fruit, as fresh fruit.

2021,42,Yield performance of oat cultivars in response to sowing dates and densities,"Adjustment of seeding density oriented by genotype and conditions of the growing environment may favor growth, development and yield performance of the oat crop. This study aimed to evaluate the growth, lodging, yield components, and grain yield of oat cultivars grown at different sowing dates and densities. Two independent experiments were conducted at two sowing dates (May 5 and June 24) in Londrina-PR under a randomized block design in a 4 × 2 factorial scheme, with four replications. Treatments consisted of four sowing densities (180, 240, 300, and 360 viable seeds m-2) and two cultivars (IPR Afrodite and IPR Artemis). Plant height, number of panicles.m-2, number of spikelets per panicle, number of grains per spikelet, number of grains per panicle, thousand-grain weight, plant lodging, and grain yield were evaluated. The data were submitted to the analysis of joint variance for sowing dates, separately for the cultivars. The averages of sowing dates were compared by the F test and densities submitted to polynomial regression analysis up to 2nd degree, at 5% probability. The first sowing date favors most yield components and grain yield of the cultivars IPR Afrodite and IPR Artemis. In contrast, the number of panicles m-2 was reduced during this growing season for both cultivars. The late sowing date for the IPR Artemis cultivar resulted in a high percentage of lodging at all evaluated densities. However, this phenomenon is more intense at higher sowing densities during the first sowing date. Yield components and grain yield varied according to sowing dates and densities and the cultivar. The highest grain yield of the cultivar IPR Afrodite at the first sowing date was achieved with a lower sowing density than in the later date. However, the highest grain yield of the IPR Artemis cultivar was achieved at density of 280 viable seeds m-2, regardless of the growing season.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42799/29959,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Human post exposure anti-rabies prophylactic assistance in the south of Brazil,"Rabies is a zoonosis caused by Lyssavirus, with progressive development and a high lethality rate.

2021,42,Identification of Brachyspira spp. in the cecum of broiler chickens using histology and in situ diagnostic assays,"The genus Brachyspira corresponds to the group of bacteria formerly classified into the genus Serpulina and includes several commensal and pathogenic intestinal spirochetes that affect pigs, poultry, and other animal species, including humans. In birds, some pathogenic species of this genus causes a condition known as avian intestinal spirochetosis, which remains underdiagnosed, thereby causing serious economic losses. Brachyspira is a fastidious organism that necessitates the employment of fast and efficient identification techniques. The aim of this study was to identify Brachyspira spp. using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from the cecum of commercial poultry. Samples were collected from 129 birds aged between 35 and 45 days from commercial broiler farms. For evaluation, routine histology processing (H&E) and the histochemical technique, periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) were done. Additionally, FFPE tissue samples were evaluated for FISH and IHC. The histological lesions were analyzed and graded after H&E staining, and the goblet cells were counted and compared using PAS staining with the positive and negative samples obtained through FISH and IHC. For FISH, probes labeled with Brachyspira spp., B. pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae, and B. intermedia were used, whereas rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Brachyspira spp. was used for IHC. Of 129 samples, 82 were positive with IHC and 86 were positive with FISH. The samples positive for the genus Brachyspira in the FISH technique were tested for B. pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae, and B. intermedia in which 56 were positive for B. pilosicoli, 75 for B. hyodysenteriae and 80 for B. intermedia.

Over two years (2017 to 2019), 1,435 sheep were subjected to clinical and parasitological evaluations. Sheep from six breeds (Santa Inês, Dorper, White Dorper, Ile de France, Suffolk, and crossbreed) were subdivided into five production categories (pregnant, lactating, non-pregnant/lactating ewes, breeding males, and weaned lambs). Parasitological evaluations included FEC and coproculture. In the clinical evaluation, all sheep underwent determination of the FAMACHA© score and PCV. Haemonchus sp. larvae were predominant in coprocultures of the flocks (76.4%) and in each animal production category evaluated (69.4 to 84.3%). FAMACHA© method showed high sensitivity (70.6%) for evaluating sheep with scores bigger smaleer 3, and PCV smaller 23%, and high specificity (97.5%) in animals with higher scores (4 and 5), and PCV smaller 18%. A negative correlation was observed between FAMACHA© scores and PCV (-0.46) and between PCV and FEC (-0.47), while a positive correlation was observed between FAMACHA© scores and FEC (0.22) (p bigger smaleer 0.01). The vast majority of the animals evaluated (54.5%) were clinically resistant to gastrointestinal parasites.

In study I, 75 high-milk production cows with body condition scores (BCSs) of 2.75 to 4.75 and ages of 23 to 99 months were selected. On the day of estrus, AFCs (follicles bigger, smaller 3 mm), BCS, body weight, and diameters of the dominant follicle, ovaries and the corpus luteum were evaluated. Posteriorly, AFC was monitored in pregnant cows at 30 days (n = 35) and at 60 days for comparison of AFC before pregnancy versus different periods. In study II, heifers (n = 9) with BCS of 2.5 to 3.5 and ages of 10 to 16 months were selected for ovum pick-up and an IVEP program before AI (nonpregnant) as well as at 0 to 30, 31 to 60, and bigger 60 days of pregnancy. Statistical analysis was performed using PROC GLM and binary logistic regression model (P bigger, smaller 0.05). In study I, AFC was not associated with variations in productive and reproductive parameters. However, AFCs in the low group increased following pregnancy (AI: 14.82 ± 1.36, 30 days: 23.45 ± 2.31 and 60 days: 35.18 ± 3.17 follicles). AFCs increased from AI to 60 days in the intermediate group but did not vary among time points in the high group. AFCs varied among AFC groups in AI and at 30 days of pregnancy but not at 60 days. In study II, the mean of total oocytes (17.43 ± 4.52 vs. 41.67 ± 3.79) and viable oocytes (13.77 ± 3.63 vs. 30.56 ± 3.45) increased from AI (nonpregnant) to the first 30 days of pregnancy. The mean number of embryos produced increased during pregnancy and during the first 30 days of pregnancy (4.55 ± 0.75) compared to the nonpregnant period (1.39 ± 0.85). In conclusion, pregnancy positively influences AFC, and the greatest effect is noted in low count cows. In addition, the OPU at the time of pregnancy increased the efficiency of IVEP in heifers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42793/29922,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Occurrence of Lawsonia intracellularis in horses raised in three regions of the state of Paraná, Brazil","Lawsonia intracellularis is a bacterium already described in several species and most prevalent in pigs, in which it causes enteric problems. Horses can also be affected, developing a disease known as equine proliferative enteropathy, which results from the proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in response to infection by the bacterium. Despite the existence of reports of the disease in several countries, including Brazil, there are still no reports of the disease or epidemiological studies of its occurrence in symptomatic or asymptomatic horses in the state of Paraná. Thus, the present study was conducted to examine the occurrence of L. intracellularis in asymptomatic horses raised in the west, northwest and north regions of Paraná by means of serological testing and the real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique. In the serological approach, the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) technique was employed. Feces were processed and subjected to qPCR. In total, samples were collected from 162 animals from 20 farms. Of these, 9/162 (5.55%) showed specific antibodies against L. intracellularis. Real-time PCR, on the other hand, identified 7/162 (4.32%) fecal samples positive for the presence of the bacterium. When the techniques were compared, none of the samples was positive by both, demonstrating that, for a better diagnosis, they must be performed together. In contrast to most reports in horses, the present study describes higher serological and molecular occurrence in animals older than two years. These results are of great epidemiological relevance, as they indicate that the bacterium is present in the sampled regions of the state of Paraná. Therefore, the disease must be included in the differential diagnosis of diseases with similar clinical manifestations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42801/29961,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Management tools applied to milk quality in cattle farming in the Western Amazon,"This study aimed to analyze the applicability of management tools such as SWOT matrix, GUT matrix, Brainstorming, PDCA, Ishikawa diagram, and 5W2H in improving milk quality in rural properties for family labor. The survey was conducted in 18 properties in the municipality of Senador Guiomard, State of Acre, Brazil, during the period from January to December 2019. The properties were divided into two groups (treatment group-TG and control group-CG) and the data obtained through a form with 255 questions for diagnosis and analysis (LQL-GO) for somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC) were tabulated in spreadsheets (Excel®) and subjected to statistical analysis by the Wilcoxon test. Nineteen weaknesses were obtained through the GUT matrix. The implementation of milking practices using tools obtained an average reduction of 31.4% for SCC and 63% for TBC in TG and a reduction of 39.3% for SCC and an increase of 33.7% for TBC in CG. Thus, the management tools applied to milk quality are capable of generating positive results (p < 0.05) in microbiological control, facilitating quick decision-making, aiming at the correction of weaknesses, and, consequently, an increase in profitability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42984/29921,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Effect of crushed sugarcane on performance, bone characteristics and intestinal morphology of free-range chicken lines","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different levels of crushed sugarcane in the diet on the performance, bone characteristics and intestinal morphology of slow-growing broiler strains. A total of 448 chickens at 35 days of age were allotted to two randomized blocks in a 4×2 factorial arrangement (levels of feed replacement with crushed sugarcane, on a fresh-matter basis: 0, 15, 30, and 45%) and two strains (Pesadão and Label Rouge (LR)). Two replicates were used per block over time (containing the treatments and the strains), and 14 individuals were used per experimental unit. Weight gain and feed intake decreased linearly in response to the increasing sugarcane levels. Feed intake was higher in the Pesadão strain than in LR. Chicken foot weight was lower in Pesadão than in LR. There were no effects of sugarcane levels or strains on the tarsometatarsal bone weight, breaking strength, maximum load and deformation. The dry matter (DM) content of the tarsometatarsal bone was lower in LR than in Pesadão. The replacement of feed with sugarcane induced a linear increase in bone ash content and a decrease in bone phosphorus and calcium contents. Label Rouge chickens showed a greater crypt depth and lower values of villus/crypt ratio and mucosal layer thickness. The performance and intestinal morphology of broiler chickens are negatively affected by increasing sugarcane levels in the diet. In addition, the increasing intake of sugarcane changes the bone mineral composition without reducing mechanical resistance, in both the Pesadão and Label Rouge strains.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40634/29988,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Use of different combinations of enzyme complexes in broiler diets,"Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of “on top” addition of different enzyme complexes, the enzyme alfa-galactosidase and three sources of the enzyme phytase available on the market, in broiler diets. In the first experiment, 1260 one-day-old Cobb 500R chicks were distributed into seven treatments in a completely randomized design (CRD) with six replicates and 30 birds/replicate. Treatments consisted of combinations of different enzyme complexes, namely, complex A (phytase, protease, xylanase, beta-glucanase, cellulase, amylase, pectinase), complex B (protease and cellulase) and complex C (xylanase, amylase and protease); isolated alfa-galactosidase (GAL); and three sources of phytase (P1, P2 and P3) in the diet. The treatments were formulated as follows: T1 - basal diet (BD); T2 - BD + enzyme complex A + enzyme complex B (BDAB); T3 - BDAB + GAL; T4 - BD + complex A + GAL; T5 - BD + complex C + P1 + GAL (BDCG); T6 - BDCG + P2; and T7 - BDCG + P3. The following variables were measured in the experimental period of 42 days: feed intake (FI), weight gain (WG), average final weight (AFW), feed conversion (FC), and carcass yield. Significant differences occurred for AFW, WG and FC in the pre-starter phase. In the second experiment, 112 Cobb 500R chicks aged 25 days were distributed into seven treatments in a CRD with four replicates and four birds/replicate. Treatments were the same as in the first experiment. Nutrient digestibility was evaluated in an experimental period of seven days. Differences were found in the metabolism coefficient of ether extract (MCEE). Dietary inclusion of enzyme complexes improves the AFW and WG of chickens from 1 to 7 days of age and MCEE in the grower phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40978/29924,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Influence of caprine arthritis encephalitis on milk production and quality along the lactation curve in primiparous dairy goats,"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) on the production of milk and its components (protein, fat and total solids) along the lactation curve of primiparous goats. The study was developed using a database from the years 2014 to 2018. Sixty-one animals were subjected to the serological test for CAE, whose result indicated that 42 were seropositive and 19 seronegative, and milk production and quality data were compiled. To adjust the curve for production of milk, fat, protein and total solids during lactation, the following nonlinear model developed by Wood (1967) was used: Y = atb e –ct, where Y represents the observations of milk, fat, protein or total solid production at time t; a is the parameter associated with the initial production; b is the parameter associated with the rate of rise in production until the peak; c is the parameter associated with the rate of decline of the lactation curve; and t is the representative time of the day in milk. The parameters were compared by the confidence interval considering 95% probability. Peak production was calculated using the following formula: A (b /c) be-b. There was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between seropositive and seronegative primiparous goats for initial production and the rates of rise and decline of the parameters of milk, fat, protein and total solid production. However, at their peak, these variables were 26, 27, 23 and 23% higher, respectively, in the seronegative goats than in their seropositive counterparts. In conclusion, CAE does not affect milk production or the production of fat, protein and total solids along the lactation curve, but seropositive goats produce less milk and respective components at the peak of the lactation curve than seronegative goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41388/29925,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Cox-Gompertz model for analysis of the time of stay in an Anglo-Nubian goat herd,"Anglo-Nubian goats are hardy animals able to adapt to tropical environments, where their farming is usually held on pasture. However, climatic conditions in this environment also favor endoparasitism, which implies a negative aspect if sensitivity to worm infections interferes by reducing the reproductive lifespan of females, as their stay in the herd is a trait of great importance for efficient goat farming. In this respect, this study proposes to use the survival analysis methodology with the Cox-Gompertz proportional hazards model to assess the length of stay in the herd by relating the removal of females due to death with worm infection being the main cause to other forms of culling, using information from 101 Anglo-Nubian goats born from 2009 to 2013 in an experimental herd from Teresina - PI, Brazil. The Cox-Gompertz proportional hazards model chose body condition score, birth weight and birth season as important covariates (p-value bigger smaller 10%). Body condition score showed to be a favorable factor for the longer stay of the goats in the herd. Eggs per gram, age at first kidding, birth type and dam age were not significant. The Cox-Gompertz proportional hazards model is suitable for fitting the statistical model to estimate the length of stay in the herd, with censoring related to endoparasitism in Anglo-Nubian goats.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41593/29926,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Use of glycosaminoglycans from Oreochromis niloticus skin as an antioxidant supplement for milt cryopreservation of Brazilian bocachico,"The study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant action of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from the skin of Oreochromis niloticus, and to determine their ideal concentration to supplement the sperm freezing medium of Prochilodus brevis. In experiment 1, the in vitro antioxidant properties of GAGs were verified through the analysis of DPPH, chelating ferrous ability, and total antioxidant capacity. In experiment 2, milt pools were formed, which were frozen in solution supplemented or not with different GAGs concentrations: 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0 mg mL-1 (total of 10 treatments). The samples were evaluated for membrane integrity, DNA integrity, sperm morphology, and sperm kinetics. The results of experiment 1 showed that the GAGs exhibited, with the increase of the concentration, significant antioxidant action, for all the evaluated tests, mainly in the chelating ferrous ability. In experiment 2, it was observed that the increase of GAGs concentration decreased kinetic parameters (P < 0.05), however, the control and 0.5 mg mL-1 GAGs concentration showed similar results. For the other parameters (membrane integrity, DNA integrity, and sperm morphology), there was no decrease in results with the increase of GAGs concentration. In conclusion, GAGs extracted from O. niloticus skin have antioxidant action, and the concentration of 0.5 mg mL-1 was the most adequate to supplement the P. brevis sperm-freezing medium.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41826/29962,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Forage characteristics and beef cattle production in perennial pastures of BRS Paiaguás and BRS Piatã in integrated crop livestock system,"The integrated crop-livestock system is highlighted in Brazilian agriculture, in which the synergism between the components can increase productivity and animal performance. Forage is one of the most important components because it is the basis of animal feed. Thus, the objective of the study was to evaluate the beef cattle production and pastures characteristics of Urochloa brizantha ‘BRS Piatã’ and ‘BRS Paiaguás’, under continuous grazing in an integrated crop livestock system. The experiment was conducted in west of Sao Paulo State, in a randomized complete block design with two treatments and three replicates, from October 2018 to June 2019. The treatments were 3-year-old pastures of BRS Piatã and Paiaguás, in an integrated crop livestock system with perennial pasture and soybean. Nellore steers (14 ± 2 months old and 244 ± 13 kg initial weight) were used. The grazing method adopted was a continuous stocking with a variable rate to maintain a pasture height of 30 cm. Herbage mass was 5716 and 5480 kg dry matter ha-1 for Piatã and Paiaguás, respectively. The crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were similar between the two cultivars. The leaf blade mass of BRS Piatã was greater than that of BRS Paiaguás in summer. Animal performance was similar between treatments, with average daily gain of 0.901 and 0.822 kg day-1 and weight gain per area of 888 and 865 kg ha-1 in Piatã and Paiaguás, respectively. The BRS Piatã and BRS Paiaguás grasses are indicated for use in perennial pastures in integrated crop livestock systems.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41912/29928,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Respiratory profile and gill histopathology of Carassius auratus exposed to different salinity concentrations,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the chronic salinity tolerance of Carassius auratus and the effects on blood parameters, gill morphology, and survival. In the first test, nine different concentrations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, and 25 g L-1) of NaCl were used with nine repetitions for 96 h. The survival of fish subjected to 15 g L-1 NaCl was 4 h, and 5 min at a concentration of 25 g L-1. The mortality of fish with 15 g L-1 NaCl was 100%. Morphological analyses of the gills showed hyperplasia of the coated cells in the interlamellar space and hypersecretion of mucus in fish exposed to 10 g L-1 of NaCl. At concentrations of 20 and 25 g L-1, necrosis of the support collagen caused the cells to detach from the lamellar structure mucosa. In the chronic test, two concentrations were used, with four replications containing nine fish in each aquarium for a period of 21 days. Blood samples and gills from the fish were collected, and it was observed that the fish showed a decrease in the concentration of bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in the blood, indicating hypernatremia. Acute exposure of C. auratus to sodium chloride (NaCl) should be at a maximum of 10 g L-1 of NaCl, after which level there would be a loss in animal performance and/or mortality. Chronic exposure to 5 g L-1 of NaCl promotes acidemia, ionic imbalance, and pathological changes in the gills; therefore, it is not recommended.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41949/29964,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Xylanases in diets with alternative feeds and energy reduction in commercial layers,"The use of alternative ingredients has been increasing in a continuing attempt to reduce production costs, along with the use of additives, such as carbohydrates, for their possible positive effects on nutrient metabolization by layers. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different xylanases in diets with reduced metabolizable energy (ME) and the inclusion of alternative ingredients on the metabolizability of nutrients in diets for commercial laying hens, by conducting two metabolism tests. In the first trial,100 layers hens were distributed in a fully randomized 2 × 2+1 factorial design (two metabolizable energy reductions × two xylanases, plus one control diet). In the second assay,140layer hens were distributed in a fully randomized 2 × 3+2 factor design (two xylanases× three ingredients, plus two control diets, positive and negative). It was concluded that supplementation with pantanal xylanase improved the metabolizability of nutrients in corn-based diets and soybean meal for light commercial layers, allowing for a reduction of up to 200 kcal/kg of ME in the diets. Xylanases are more effective on wheat bran enabling a decrease of 150 kcal/kg of ME in commercial laying diets without affecting nutrient metabolizability. The action of pantanal xylanase in diets containing fibrous ingredients was similar to that of commercial xylanase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42054/29965,E-ISSN 1679-0359

A total of 1,538 male Cobb 500 broilers were allocated to the three experiments, each of which consisted of five treatments: positive control (PC; basal ration); negative control 1 (NC1; PC minus 0.15% of AP, 0.16% of Ca, and 68 kcal kg-1 ME); negative control 2 (NC2; PC minus 0.15% of AP, 0.16% of Ca, and 101 kcal kg-1 of ME); NC1 plus phytase; and NC2 plus phytase plus enzymatic complex. Body weight gain (WG) and feed intake were measured from 1-21 days and from 1-42 days, and the corrected feed conversion rate (FCR) for mortality was calculated. In the second and third experiments, the apparent ME corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn) and standardized digestibility of amino acids, respectively, were determined, for the diets supplemented with phytase and the enzymatic complex. In the first experiment, enzyme supplementation increased (p < 0.05) WG at 21 days and 42 days relative to the negative controls. Phytase inclusion improved (p < 0.05) FCR at the initial phase compared to the NC1 diet. In the second experiment, enzyme supplementation did not affect (p > 0.05) AMEn. In the third experiment, both enzyme treatments improved (p < 0.05) the digestibility of amino acids in the supplemented diets compared to the deficient diets. Supplementation with phytase and carbohydrases preserves the performance of broilers fed diets deficient in AP, Ca, and ME and improves amino acid digestibility.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42762/29931,E-ISSN 1679-0359

One animal presented suggestive lesions and samples from lung, spleen and heart were submitted to microbiological culture in Stonebrink medium for 90 days and molecular analysis by nested-PCR. For histopathological examination and Ziehl Neelsen staining, the omentum was used. In the cultured samples, two of them (heart and spleen) showed growth, but were not confirmed as M. bovis by conventional PCR. At nested-PCR, the samples showed amplification for the TbD1 region. The presence of numerous granulomas was detected in the histopathological examination characterized by a necrotic center and areas of mineralization, as well as the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Microbiological culture can show false negative results, despite being considered a gold standard technique, although it takes time. Nested-PCR and histopathology show fast and effective results for the diagnosis of the disease. The presence of positive animals represents a public health risk in the studied region. Therefore, one of the essential systems applied to the control of bovine tuberculosis is the epidemiological surveillance of animals in slaughterhouses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41613/29932,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Libido and serving skills of Zebu cattle bulls,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the rejection rates of Zebu bulls during behavioral assessment (libido and serving ability) and the importance of this step in bull breeding soundness evaluation (BBSE). A total of 1,534 bulls reared in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, of Nelore (1,340), Brahman (76), Guzerá (98), and Tabapuã (210) breeds were evaluated. The evaluation consisted of four steps. Step I was the general physical examination, Step II genital tract examination, Step III semen evaluation, and Step IV behavioral assessment of libido and the ability to complete copulation. To evaluate the relationship between the binary variables of approved or rejected during different steps of the BBSE, and age groups (young and mature bulls), chi-square tests and logistic regression were used. The general rejection rates in the BBSE were 5.64% and 15.20% for young and mature Zebu bulls, respectively. ¬Problems with the sexual behavior (libido and/or serving ability) of bulls accounted for the rejection of 0.46% and 2.29% of young and mature Zebu bulls, respectively. The lack of libido and serving ability was shown to be an important problem concerning the total number of possible causes of Zebu bull rejection during the BBSE. This result suggests that the behavioral step should be performed regularly, rather than being complementary to the standard BBSE in Zebu cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41993/30691,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Application of chemical compounds during pre-harvesting to control post-harvesting green mold in citrus,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of system-acquired resistance inducing compounds applied during the pre-harvest of ‘Navelina’ orange and ‘Ortanique’ tangor in controlling post-harvest disease caused by Penicillium digitatum. The products applied were acibenzolar-s-methyl (ASM), imidacloprid (IMI), methyl jasmonate (MeJa), sodium selenite, potassium silicate, and thiamethoxam (TMT). Sterile distilled water was used as the control. The applications were administered 45, 30, and 15 days before harvesting. In 2015 and 2016, 840 fruits were randomly collected, and when they reached commercial maturation, they were sanitized, half were pierced with a needle in the equatorial region. The fruits were inoculated with a 10 µL spore suspension (1 × 106 conidia mL-1) of P. digitatum, in the equatorial region. The experiment was performed with three replicates, each comprising 10 fruits and repeated over two consecutive crop seasons. Disease incidence was evaluated on pierced (at 72 and 144 h after inoculation [hai]) and unperforated (at 360 hai) fruits. For pierced fruits, lesion expansion rate (rL), disease severity, expansion rate of sporulating area (rE), and sporulating area were evaluated. The area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the area under the sporulating area progress curve were calculated. Both cultivars were susceptible; however, the rL and rE had lower values for 'Ortanique'. The tested products reduced the disease incidence in both cultivars. Potassium silicate reduced rL and rE, whereas sodium selenite reduced rE. The disease severity was reduced by potassium silicate, sodium selenite, and ASM. AUDPC was reduced by sodium selenite and potassium silicate treatments. Among the tested products, potassium silicate and sodium selenite applied during the pre-harvest of 'Navelina' orange and 'Ortanique' tangor had the highest reductions for disease incidence (ranging from 14% to 37%, respectively) and severity (60% and 70%, respectively), rE (50% for both compounds), and total sporulating area (55% and 56%, respectively), reducing the green mold in post-harvested fruits caused by P. digitatum.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40263/29649,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Does elevated CO2 affect the biological aspects of Liriomyza sativae in melon plants?,"An increase in the carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) in the atmosphere has occurred in recent years, influencing the different biological aspects of herbivorous insects. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CO2 increase on the biological aspects of Liriomyza sativae Blanchard leafminer in melon plants. For this, two experiments were carried out: (i) to evaluate the effect of melon plants grown in CO2-enriched environments on the immature developmental stages of L. sativae and L. sativae adult longevity, and (ii) to verify the impact of increased CO2 concentration on L. sativae adult survival, feeding punctures, and oviposition. The experiments were carried out in growth chambers maintained in the temperature regime of 20-26-33 °C (simulating the minimum, average, and maximum daily temperature) and under two CO2 concentrations (400 ppm and 770 ppm).The immature stages and the egg-adult period of L. sativae were longer when they were grown on plants grown in high CO2 levels (770 ppm), but no difference in adult longevity was observed. The viability of the immature phases was not different between the two CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, there was no difference in the number of eggs and feeding punctures between treatments. Thus, the increase in CO2 concentration prolongs the duration of the immature stages of L. sativae; however, it does not affect their viability. Adult survival, fertility, and feeding punctures were also unmodified by the environment enriched with CO2.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40921/29650,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Estimation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) leaf area by a non-destructive method,"The aim of this study was to develop mathematical models to estimate the leaf area of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in irrigated and non-irrigated water regimes from linear dimensions. An experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with a 3×2 factorial arrangement (three cultivars: Triunfo, Garapiá and FC 104; two water regimes: irrigated and non-irrigated) with 25 replicates each. A total of 523 trifoliates were collected throughout the crop cycle. The length (L, cm) and width (W, cm) of the central leaflet of the trifoliate were measured and their product (LW) (cm²) calculated. Then, the leaf area of these trifoliates was determined by digital photography methods using ImageJ® software, and using leaf discs. The number of samples required to estimate the leaf area of a trifoliate was determined to define which method is the most accurate to be used as the real leaf area in generating equations to estimate the leaf area in common bean. The relationship between area by digital photographs and the dimensions of the central leaflet of the trifoliate (L, W and LW) was fitted by linear, quadratic and power models. Subsequently, the predictive capacity of the equations was assessed by the root mean square error (cm2 trifoliate-1), mean absolute error (cm2 trifoliate-1), index of agreement and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Sample size varied between cultivars, water regimes and evaluation methods. It is more appropriate to use the leaf area provided by ImageJ® as real for comparison purposes in generating models to estimate leaf area from linear measurements, in common bean. The general equation LA = 1.092L1.945 can be used in the tested regimes without accuracy losses.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41724/29651,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Spatio-temporal variability of biophysical parameters of irrigated maize using orbital remote sensing,"This study proposes to estimate the actual crop evapotranspiration, using the SAFER model, as well as calculate the crop coefficient (Kc) as a function of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and determine the biomass of an irrigated maize crop using images from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared (TIRS) sensors of the Landsat-8 satellite. Pivots 21 to 26 of a commercial farm located in the municipalities of Bom Jesus da Lapa and Serra do Ramalho, west of Bahia State, Brazil, were selected. Sowing dates for each pivot were arranged as North and South or East and West, with cultivation starting firstly in one of the orientations and subsequently in the other. The relationship between NDVI and the Kc values obtained in the FAO-56 report (KcFAO) revealed a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.7921), showing that the variance of KcFAO can be explained by NDVI in the maize crop. Considering the center pivots with different planting dates, the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) pixel values ranged from 0.0 to 6.0 mm d-1 during the phenological cycle. The highest values were found at 199 days of the year (DOY), corresponding to around 100 days after sowing (DAS). The lowest BIO values occur at 135 DOY, at around 20 DAS. There is a relationship between ETc and BIO, where the DOY with the highest BIO are equivalent to the days with the highest ETc values. In addition to this relationship, BIO is strongly influenced by soil water availability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41948/29653,E-ISSN 1679-0359

An alternative to address this problem is the cuttings technique, a simple and fast method that generates individuals identical to the parent plant, maintaining the agronomic traits. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of cutting collection time and indolebutyric acid (IBA) on the rooting of 'Bruno' kiwifruit cuttings. The cuttings were collected in the months of May, August and December 2016 and March 2017 and treated with 0, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg L -1 IBA, as a hydroalcoholic solution, for seven seconds. After 90 days, the percentages of rooted and dead cuttings and cuttings that produced shoots; leaf retention; average length of the three largest roots; average number of primary roots per cutting; and reserve contents before and after rooting were evaluated. The treatments with IBA influenced the rooting of cuttings collected in May, which showed 36.07% rooting at the calculated IBA concentration of 2,320 mg L -1, and in December, which exhibited 57.59% rooting at the concentration of 4000 mg L -1. In the present experimental conditions, it is recommended to root cuttings of 'Bruno' kiwifruit collected in December with the application of 4000 mg L -1 IBA.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42003/29654,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Production and water-use efficiency of Megathyrsus maximus cv. Mombaça “Guinea grass” under nitrogen and boron doses,"Brazilian cattle production is mainly conducted with the use of cultivated or native forages, which is considered one of the most efficient ways of production. In this sense, this study aimed to evaluate the production and water-use efficiency of Guinea grass under different associations between nitrogen and boron doses, as well as different regrowth cycles. The experiment field (22o42’14.6” S, 47o37’24.1” W, and 569 - m altitude) has a regional climate classified as Cwa, which stands for a humid subtropical climate. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with a 4×4×11 factorial arrangement consisting of boron (0, 0.181, and 0.363 kg ha-1 cycle-1) and nitrogen (22.7, 45.5, 68.2, and 90.9 kg ha-1 cycle-1) fertilizations, plus 11 regrowth cycles and 4 replications. The pasture of Mombaça “Guinea grass” (Megathyrsus Maximus Syn. Panicum Maximum) was irrigated by a sprinkler system. Unlike boron, nitrogen positively influenced forage production. The cycles had a strong influence on production, with winter cycles being the least productive compared to the others.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42064/29696,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Yield and physiological quality of wheat seeds produced under different irrigation depths and leaf Silicon,"Water availability is one of the main factors responsible for wheat productivity, as well as the quality of the produced seeds. Silicon (Si) has an important role in mitigating the effects of various biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, Si application can be used to mitigate the effects of different irrigation depths on the production and quality of wheat seeds. The work aimed to evaluate the yield and physiological quality of wheat seeds produced from plants fertilized with leaf Si and grown under different irrigation depths. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot randomized block design, with four replications. The plots consisted of three irrigation depths (0, 50, and 100% of the total irrigation requirement [TIR]). Si treatments were allocated (without application [0 mM] and 5 mM SiO2, applied at the tillering stage) in the subplots. The following parameters were evaluated: water balance of the system; soil moisture; yield; thousand seed weight; germination; electrical conductivity; accelerated aging; seedling length and emergence. The water balance of the system was negative for the 0% TIN irrigation depth after anthesis and there was less soil moisture in this irrigation depth. There was no effect of irrigation depths and Si application on plant yield. The smaller irrigation depths imposed reduced the thousand seed weight and increased the electrical conductivity of the seeds produced. Plants fertilized with Si did not differ in germination, but they produced more vigorous seedlings with greater growth and uniformity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42168/29724,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Foliar application of H2O2 as salt stress attenuator in ‘BRS Rubi do Cerrado’ sour passion fruit,"Irrigation with saline water causes a reduction in yield, especially in semi-arid regions. Cultivation strategies have been developed to mitigate salt stress on plants, such as the use of hydrogen peroxide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the attenuating effect of hydrogen peroxide on the gas exchange and growth of ‘BRS Rubi do Cerrado’ sour passion fruit cultivated under irrigation with saline water. The design was completely randomized in split-plot plots, with water salinity levels ECw (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.0 dS m-1) considered the plots and the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 (0, 15, 30, and 45 uM) considered the subplots, with three replicates. Gas exchange (stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, instantaneous water use efficiency, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency), and absolute and relative growth rates in stem diameter were evaluated. An increase in irrigation water salinity from 0.6 dS m-1 reduced gas exchange, and exogenous application of hydrogen peroxide did not promote a significant effect on gas exchange. However, foliar application of hydrogen peroxide at 15 uM increased the growth of ‘BRS Rubi do Cerrado’ sour passion fruit.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42169/29657,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Energy efficiency in maize crops in different regions of Brazil,"Assessment of energy efficiency (EE) enables the evaluation of the sustainability of agrosystems, as well as decision-making regarding reduction in production costs and environmental pollution and even to increase production in a sustainable way. In this context, the objective of this study was to assess energy efficiency in maize in different regions of Brazil. For this purpose, 32 areas of maize crop distributed across the major producing states and regions were assessed. Energy inputs and outputs of agricultural operations and/or agricultural inputs were calculated by multiplying the amount used by their calorific value or energy coefficient at each stage of production. Energy efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the total output energy and the total input energy during the production process. For every megajoule (MJ) of energy consumed in the production of second-crop maize and first-crop maize seasons, 9.9 and 8.7 MJ respectively of renewable energy were produced in the form of grain. In both maize cropping seasons, most of the energy use was attributed to fertilizers, herbicides and fuel. To be representative the evaluation of energy efficiency of the maize crop should be performed in different Brazilian cultivation regions, as it will represent different edaphoclimatic and management conditions spread over the national territory within an agricultural year.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42214/29658,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Blends of cassava starch with banana flours as raw materials for gluten-free biscuits,"The growth in demand for gluten-free products linked mainly to health aspects has led to an increased interest in the production of mixed flours for use in bakery products. This work aimed to evaluate the use of different mixtures of cassava starch with banana flour, obtained from the pulp and peel of green fruits, for the production of gluten-free biscuits. In the preparation of the biscuits, seven mixtures were prepared with varying percentages of cassava starch, banana pulp flour and banana peel flour. A formulation with wheat flour was used as a control. Wheat flour, cassava starch and banana flours were analyzed for chemical composition. The results showed that the banana peel flour stood out for its higher levels of proteins, fibres, lipids, ash, total phenols, total flavonoids and antioxidant activity which make this flour effective as a functional additive. However, the results of physical and sensory characteristics of the biscuits showed that the variation in the percentage of banana peel flour led to greater changes in the quality attributes of the biscuits, so the percentage of inclusion should be limited. Banana pulp flour (UBF) had high starch content, however, the biscuits produced with higher percentages of this flour and lower percentages of cassava starch showed lower propagation rates, greater hardness and less sensory acceptance, showing the importance of the starchy raw material in the physical properties of biscuits. Formulations containing cassava starch mixed with up to 15% banana flour (1:1, pulp and peel) are a good basis for making gluten-free biscuits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41943/29659,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Functional potential and food safety of fresh-cut ‘Paluma’ guava under edible coatings,"Guava is a fruit rich in antioxidants and its value can be enhanced by fresh-cut processing, which increases convenience for consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in bioactive compounds, total antioxidant activity (TAA) and microbial quality in slices of fresh-cut (FC) ‘Paluma’ guava coated with chitosan at 2% (Q), calcium chloride at 1% (CC), calcium chloride at 1% + sodium alginate at 1% (CC + A), calcium chloride at 1% + chitosan at 2% (CC + Q), and control (T - without coating). Coated slices were packed in trays, wrapped with PVC film and kept at 3 ± 1 °C and 75 ± 4% RH for 12 days and evaluated for ascorbic acid, lycopene, beta-carotene, total extractable polyphenols (TEP), and TAA by ABTS+- and DPPH . Ascorbic acid content of slices did not differ by coatings, but TEP was higher in slices coated with Q. The TAA by DPPH was higher in slices coated with Q, however, by ABTS + - it was higher in those coated with Q, CC and CC + Q. No thermotolerant coliforms or Salmonella were detected in FC guava from any treatment. However, slices coated with Q showed the lowest counts of total coliforms and molds and yeasts. Therefore, the application of Q coating provided microbiological safety to FC guava, still maintaining the levels of bioactive compounds and TAA superior to the control slices, which can characterize this as a healthy FC product, with superior functional potential.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42016/29660,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Influencing factors for preparation of platelet-rich plasma in horses,"There is no consensus in the literature as to the best platelet-rich plasma (PRP) acquisition method or the ideal platelet concentration to stimulate tissue repair. Besides that, most studies do not provide a clear and replicable description of the methods used, which makes standardization and result comparison difficult. Thus, this study aimed to accurately describe the method and evaluate factors influencing PRP preparation in equines. In this regard, two protocols were used, P1 and P2, based on two centrifugation methods, which differed in blood volume, speed and time, and platelet pipetting and resuspension. In conclusion, factors such as centrifugation strength and time are essential to obtain PRP with adequate platelet count. However, other factors such as tube type and plasma pipetting and resuspension methods directly interfere with the replicability of the technique, and hence influencing PRP applicability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39503/29661,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Comparison of urinary protein-to-creatinine ration, serum albumin, serum creatinine and systolic arterial blood pressure of glomerular injury cases in dogs with chronic kidney disease","This study aims at assessing the prevalence of glomerular alterations in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and comparing the clinical and laboratory parameters. The tests conducted include a double-blind histopathological assay conducted by two pathologists, urine tests including inactive sediment, urinary protein-to-creatinine (UPC), serum albumin and serum creatinine, as well as measurement of the systolic arterial blood pressure. The prevalence of glomerular injuries was determined and the predominant injury was compared with a group comprised of the remaining injuries. The study included 24 dogs with CKD. The results revealed a predominance of membranous glomerular alterations 17/24 (70,83%), followed by glomerulosclerosis 3/24 (12,50%), membranoproliferative injuries 2/24, glomerulocystic atrophy 1/24 and glomerular amyloidosis 1/24. Amyloidosis presented the highest UPC while the membranoproliferative injury presented the lowest mean concentration of serum albumin. Higher values in the UPC did not correspond with lower mean serum albumin values. Glomerulosclerosis presented the highest mean systolic blood pressure and glomerular atrophy presented the highest creatinine values. When comparing membranous injuries with a group comprised of the remaining injuries, the UPC did not present significant differences between the groups. Renal amyloidosis was included in the group with the lowest systolic arterial blood pressure values while membranoproliferative injury was included in the group with highest UPC. The group called “others” presented the highest creatinine value. Dogs with CKD may present several types of glomerular injuries with similar clinical and laboratory profiles.

2021,42,Application of hormonal subdoses at the Bai Hui acupoint for estrus synchronization in sheep,"Here, the efficiency of applying subdoses of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and prostaglandin F2 alfa (PGF2alfa) at the Bai Hui (BH) acupoint for estrus synchronization in sheep was evaluated. Thirty Santa Inês ewes received intravaginal sponges containing 60 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate for 7 days. The animals were divided into five treatments (T) (n=6): T1 (control), 132.5 ug PGF2 alfa (100% of dose) and 300 IU eCG (100% of dose), both intramuscularly (IM); T2, 39.75 ug PGF2 alfa (30% of dose) at the BH acupoint and 300 IU eCG (100% of dose) IM; T3, 132.5 ug PGF2 alfa (100% of dose) IM and 90 IU eCG (30% of dose) at the BH acupoint; T4, 39.75 ug PGF2 alfa (30% of dose) and 90 IU eCG (30% of dose), both at the BH acupoint; and T5, 39.75 ug PGF2 alfa (30% of dose) and 90 IU eCG (30% of dose) both at a false acupoint (IM, at the same location as in T1). After 12 h of sponge removal and hormone application, the ewes were subjected to monitoring for estrus and mating and ultrasound assessments of follicular growth and ovulation time every 12 h. The data were evaluated for normality and subjected to analysis of variance, considering a 5% probability. There were no differences in the percentage of animals in estrus (93.3±9.1%), interval from sponge removal to estrus onset (48.1±6.0 h), interval from sponge removal to estrus end (69.6±5.4 h), duration of estrus (24.0±4.7 h), interval from sponge removal to ovulation (73.7±5.9 h), interval from estrus onset to ovulation (26.5±2.3 h), size of the largest follicle (6.7±0.4 mm), follicular growth rate (0.8±0.1 mm•day-1), number of ovulations (1.3±0.1), and plasma progesterone levels 7 days after ovulation (9.6±2.0 ng•mL-1). The cost of the synchronization protocol per animal was US$ 4.37, 4.12, 2.96, 2.71, and 2.71 for T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively, with 37.99% cost reduction using PGF2 alfa and eCG at 30% of the conventional doses. Therefore, the application of reduced PGF2 alfa (39.75 ug) and eCG (90 IU) doses at the BH or false acupoint effectively synchronized estrus and reduced protocol cost in sheep, indicating that the conventional doses are overestimated.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40913/29663,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Anthelmintic activity of the ethanolic extract of Carapa guianensis (Meliaceae) on gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep in the Western Amazon,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of energy supplementation on associative effects between forage and concentrate supplements and on the performance of beef cattle on a tropical pasture during the rainy season. Twenty-eight Nellore bulls averaging 19 months of age and 325.2 ± 4.1 kg were allotted to a completely randomized design and distributed into four paddocks of two hectares each with a tropical pasture for 84 d. The treatments consisted of bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture without concentrate supplementation or bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture receiving concentrate supplementation at 15 (S15), 30 (S30) or 45% (S45) of the total digestible nutrients (TDN) requirement. All bulls had ad libitum access to mineral supplementation. The amount and chemical composition of the supplement were adjusted every 28 d. Forage and supplement intakes were evaluated in all animals using fecal markers. Crude protein: digestible organic matter ratio decreased with supplementation; consequently, the imbalance between dietary protein and energy increased. Forage intake decreased with increasing supplementation. The substitution rates of pasture for supplementary feed were 0.14, 0.33, and 0.46 for bulls from S15, S30, and S45 treatments, respectively. However, the apparent DM digestibility increased linearly with supplementation level. Supplementation improved the assimilation of ammonia-N in the rumen. Energy supplementation for Nellore bulls on tropical pastures during the rainy season provides excess energy relative to protein, resulting in a substitution effect of supplement intake on forage intake. Moreover, energy supplementation does not improve body weight gain. Protein sources should be added to supplements for balancing protein and energy levels, thereby reducing a likely substitution effect.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41424/29693,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Effect of vaccination on the apparent prevalence of bovine brucellosis in the state of Tocantins, Brazil","A cross-sectional study on the epidemiological situation of bovine brucellosis was carried out in the state of Tocantins to evaluate the effectiveness of its vaccination program. The state was divided into five regions, and a predetermined number of farms was randomly selected in each one. Females aged 24 months or older were randomly selected in each farm and diagnosed with brucellosis by serial serology (AAT and 2-ME). A total of 6,846 animals from 756 farms were examined. The prevalence of seropositive herds in the state was 6.42% [CI95%: 4.76-8.62], and the prevalence of seropositive animals was 2.21% [CI95%: 1.05-4.01]. The prevalence of seropositive herds was homogeneously distributed among regions. The 2002/2003 study estimated the prevalence of seropositive herds in the state to be 21.22% [CI95%: 19.33-23.11]. In conclusion, the vaccination program implemented in Tocantins, reaching vaccination coverage above 70% as of 2010, significantly reduced the prevalence of seropositive herds. Thus, continuing the vaccination program in the state is recommended, preferably increasing the quality of the processes involved, from commercialization to inoculation in animals, since immunization remains the most effective means to reduce the prevalence of brucellosis. In addition, animal replacement remains a major risk factor for bovine brucellosis in Tocantins since 20022003; therefore, the state must implement a strong health education program explaining to farmers the importance of testing animals for brucellosis before introducing them into their herds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41566/29665,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Prevalence and level of infection by endoparasites in different categories of sheep in the Western Amazon,"This study aimed to understand the epidemiology of the main gastrointestinal endoparasites affecting sheep raised in the municipality of Sena Madureira, Acre, Brazil. A total of 178 fecal samples were collected from sheep raised in an extensive system of 10 farms. The samples were grouped into lambs, ewe lambs, lambing ewes, ewes, and rams for laboratory analysis by the flotation technique for counting eggs per gram of feces (EGF), oocysts of Eimeria sp., and presence of eggs of Moniezia sp. The analyzed variables consisted of the prevalence of nematodes, cestodes, and coccidia and intensity of strongylid and coccidium infection by quantification (mean ± SE) of eggs and oocysts. Prevalence data were compared by the chi-square test and intensity of infection (mean ± SE) by the Scott-Knott test (SAEG 9.1), both with P < 0.05. The overall prevalence was 77.6%, reaching 64.15% for strongylids, 36.2% for coccidia, and 8.81% for cestodes (Moniezia sp.). Ewes had the lowest prevalence (52.5%), while lambs had a prevalence of 95.5%, not differing from the others (P < 0.05). The intensity of infection by nematodes showed that lambs had the highest EGF compared to ewes, with values of 1297±270 and 232±79, respectively. The categories lambing ewes, ewes, and rams presented an average EGF below what is indicated for treatment with drugs. The highest intensity of infection was observed for ewe lambs (5859±3648), exceeding acceptable rates. Sheep raised in Sena Madureira has a high prevalence for verminosis by strongylids and a low prevalence for coccidiosis and cestodiasis. Young animal categories present a high health risk for endoparasitoses, and management measures that collaborate with the prophylaxis and control of these diseases should be adopted.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41861/29667,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Sperm filtration as an alternative technique for seminal plasma separation in boars,"The present study aimed to evaluate the filtration for separating seminal plasma of boars’ ejaculate by means of sperm viability and the occurrence of hyperactivation and lipid peroxidation in fresh semen and after cooling for up to 96 hours. The ejaculate of eight healthy boars of different breeds was collected and the gelatinous portion was separated and discarded. In the laboratory, the semen was fractioned into three aliquots (groups G1, G2 and G3) as follows: G1: semen with plasma diluted in BTS (TOTAL BTS); G2: semen centrifuged at 600G/10’ (BTS CEN); and G3: semen filtered with the Sperm-filter® following dilution of the retained cells with BTS (BTS FIL). The analyses were performed at three moments: with fresh samples (D0) and after 48 (D2) and 96 hours (D4) of cooling at 17ºC. The kinetic evaluation was performed using the CASA system, which provided data for the classification of sperm hyperactivity. For lipid stress analysis, the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) test was performed. The variance analysis test was conducted to compare the results between the groups and moments analyzed. The results showed better total motility values (%) for G1 at D0 (67.9, P= 0.001), D2 (36.6, P= 0.004) and D4 (26.1, P= 0.003). The occurrence of hyperactivity was observed in G2 and G3 at moments D2 and D4. In addition, TBARS showed higher peroxidation levels for G1 at D0 (8.1 mM MDA/ml, P= 0.01), D2 (7.4 mM MDA/ml, P= 0.02), and D4 (6.41mMol MDA/ml, P= 0.008) when compared to G2 and G3.

2021,42,Nutritional management and sexual condition in cattle determine differentiation in the fatty acid profile of meat,"This study aimed at evaluating the fatty acid profile of meat from feedlot finished heifers and steers fed with high-grain diets. It was used 45 Charolais and Nellore crossbred cattle, 21 of them were heifers with an initial age of 32 ± 2 months and 359.9 ± 6.7 kg of body weight, and 24 were steers with an initial age of 20 ± 2 months and 337.6 ± 6.2 kg of body weight. The animals were distributed in the treatments according to the energy source used in the diet, being them: rice, white oats or corn, using seven heifers and eight steers for each diet. The experimental design was completely randomized, with factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (three treatments and two sexual conditions). The diet based on corn provided higher levels of pentadecylic and margaric fatty acids. Excepting elaidic fatty acid, beef from steers and heifers was similar for the different saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids evaluated. A rice-based diet is advantageous when meat production is recommended with greater participation of fatty acids from the omega-3 group. When finished in feedlot with high-grain diets, the heifers produce meat with higher conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content and a better ratio between omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids compared to steers. These findings indicate that it is possible to modify undesirable characteristics in meat through the nutritional management of animals, searching for a product that meets the requirements of a modern population, which is redefining its principles regarding food.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40993/29670,E-ISSN 1679-0359

These compounds are also alternatives to the use of performance-enhancing antimicrobials. The objective was to evaluate the productive performance, ingestive behavior, apparent digestibility of feed DM and the carcass characteristics of beef steers finished in feedlot receiving autolyzed yeasts in the diet. The experimental design was randomized blocks, consisting of three treatments and six repetitions, where each repetition was represented by a stall with two animals. 36 bulls, ½ Angus × ½ Nelore blood, from the same herd, with an average age of 11 months and an average body weight of ± 330 kg were used. The treatments were as follows: CON - yeast-free diet; Y4 - yeast diet (4 g animal day-1) and Y7 - yeast diet (7 g animal day-1). The product used is a functional ingredient containing the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The inclusion of autolyzed yeasts resulted in greater daily body weight gain and better feed conversion in the initial feedlot phase. The apparent digestibility of DM of diets containing autolyzed yeast was superior to the control diet, and its use did not interfere with the animal ingestive behavior. Supplementation with autolyzed yeasts at the inclusion level of 4 g day-1 promoted better results in the finishing of feedlot steers, and that the supplemented groups (4 g animal day-1 and 7 g animal day-1) achieved the same degree of carcass finishing, higher than the control group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41012/29671,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Supplement inclusion on post-weaning foals’ (Mangalarga Marchador) diet with a protein supplement based on whey protein, glutamine, and lysine","The objective of this study was to evaluate the partial replacement effect on body measurements (body mass, muscle thickness, and fat thickness) of the concentrated fraction of foals’ diet with a protein supplement containing whey protein, glutamine, and lysine during the post-weaning period. Eighteen Mangalarga Marchador foals were randomly divided into two groups in the post-weaning phase, with nine animals each in the control group (CG) and the group receiving protein supplementation (WG). Based on 4% of their body weight (BW), the CG animals received a diet with roughage to concentrate in a ratio of 50:50, which composed of Cynodon sp. hay and a 15% crude protein (CP) commercial horse ration. The WG diet consisted of the same amount of hay used for the CG diet, half the amount of concentrate used in the CG diet, and 102 g of a protein supplement containing whey protein, glutamine, and lysine. During the experiment, five evaluations were performed, starting on the day of weaning (day 0), followed by evaluations conducted at 7, 14, 28, and 42 days after weaning. Body measurements, body mass, and thickness of the fat and muscle layers were assessed at each time point. The substitution of a portion of the commercial diet with protein supplement containing whey protein, glutamine, and lysine did not cause changes in the weight gain or linear measurements of Mangalarga Marchador foals during the post-weaning period; however, the change in diet increased muscle thickness and decreased fat thickness when compared to animals in the control group.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41249/29694,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effect of grazing management strategies on the yield and nutritional value of Marandu grass in the semiarid of Brazil,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two grazing management strategies on structural, productive and nutritional parameters of Marandu grass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu). A completely randomized block design with two pasture management strategies and eight replications (blocks) was used. The grazing management strategies were: (1) low intensity rotational grazing (LI), with a pre-grazing sward height of 40 cm and a post-grazing sward height of 24 cm, i.e., a defoliation intensity of 50%; (2) High intensity rotational grazing (HI), with a pre-grazing sward height of 40 cm and a post-grazing sward height of 10 cm (±70% defoliation intensity). Pastures were sampled before and after grazing for estimation of forage mass, forage accumulation rate, structural characteristics, nutritional value and dry matter intake. The LI strategy resulted in higher dry matter production than HI before (18.33%) and after grazing (49.06%), increasing pre-grazing forage density by 13.21% (P < 0.05). The production of potentially digestible dry matter was highest (P < 0.05) in LI strategy (21.3% before and 39.6% after grazing, respectively). Higher post-grazing green forage mass (45%) increased the residual crude protein in LI. The LI management strategy increased forage mass production and can be used in Marandu grass pastures.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41590/29711,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Genetic parameters and trends for reproductive traits in Blanco Orejinegro cattle from Colombia,"The Colombian creole cattle breed Blanco Orejinegro (BON) is an important zoogenetic resource, but there is little knowledge about the genetic parameters and trends of its reproductive traits. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate parameters for the reproductive traits calving interval (CI), age at first calving (AFC), gestation duration (GD) and genetic trends for CI in the BON breed. Genealogy information from 7,799 animals was used, and employing the MTDFREML program, the components of the variance, heritability (h2), repeatability (rep), and estimated breeding values (EBV) for CI (n=3308), AFC (n=729), and GD (n=306) were estimated, in addition to the inbreeding coefficient (F) of the population. Genetic trends were established through linear regression using R software. Finally, the animals were classified as inbred (F>0) and noninbred (F=0), and the effect of inbreeding on reproductive performance was established through a generalized linear model using the R program. An average F value of 4.41%±0.06 was observed. The h2 for CI was 0.11±0.03 with a rep of 0.15±0.04; for AFC, h2 was 0.00±0.05; and for GD, h2 was 0.00±0.08. The genetic trend for CI was -0.01 days/year. Finally, for CI, inbreeding depression was evident; this trait increased when inbreeding increased. These results indicate an important environmental influence on reproductive traits. The heritability estimate for CI suggests that little genetic progress could be achieved through selection. The evidence of inbreeding depression raises the need to control inbreeding to conserve this genetic resource.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41670/29674,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Grazing height and nitrogen fertilization strategy in black oat/maize succession,"This study was developed to examine the effect of combining nitrogen (N) fertilization strategies and pasture management heights on animal and grain production in an Integrated Crop-Livestock System. The experiment was carried out in the municipality of Abelardo Luz - SC, Brazil, between April 2017 and April 2018. A randomized-block design was adopted, with the treatments arranged in a 2×2 factorial arrangement with three replicates. The first factor was the height of the pasture managed under continuous grazing: high (HH, 20 cm) or low (LH, 12 cm). The second factor corresponded to the N application times: in the winter, in the pasture (NP), and in the summer, in the grain crop (NG), in a single N rate of 200 kg ha-1 as topdressing. The forage species used during the pasture phase was black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb), and the pasture was grazed by Nellore × Charolais crossbred steers with an initial body weight of 260 kg. The summer crop was maize (Zea mays). Average daily gain (ADG) and herbage allowance were higher in HH than in LH, whereas animal load was higher in HH. Between the N application times, the animal load was higher in NP. Pasture management height and N fertilization strategy did not affect the variables of number of rows per ear, number of grains per row, thousand-grain weight, or total grain yield, which overall averaged 14,090 kg ha-1. In conclusion, the inversion of nitrogen fertilization between the periods of winter pasture production and grain crop and the management height of the black oat pasture do not compromise the production of maize grains in the summer, or animal production per area. However, steer performance is greater (higher ADG) when the pasture is managed at 20 cm, whereas a high grazing intensity significantly reduces straw on the soil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41714/29675,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Performance of crossbred Holstein x Gyr dairy cows, with and without energy supplementation, in BRS Kurumi elephant grass pastures","O objetivo do estudo foi avaliar o efeito da suplementação energética com milho moído sobre o desempenho de vacas Holandês x Gir (H x G) em pastagem de capim-elefante BRS Kurumi manejado sob lotação rotacionada durante o período chuvoso. Foram utilizadas seis vacas H x G, com produção média de leite, peso corporal, escore de condição corporal e dias em lactação de 18,0±2,89 kg dia-1 de leite, 560±66 kg, 2,50±0,21 e 99±12, respectivamente. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de reversão completa (switchback). As avaliações foram realizadas durante três ciclos de pastejo, com período de adaptação de 14 dias e seis dias de coletas de amostras. O suplemento concentrado (milho moído) foi fornecido duas vezes ao dia, à razão de 2 kg vaca-1 dia-1 pela manhã e 1 kg vaca-1 dia-1 à tarde (base da matéria natural). Observou-se redução de 23,4% no consumo de matéria seca (CMS) de pasto nos animais que receberam a suplementação energética, o que corresponde a menos 2,96 kg de MS de forragem, quando comparado ao grupo sem suplementação. Este fator representa uma taxa de substituição de 1,1 kg de pasto por kg de concentrado consumido (base da MS), o que reduziu o consumo de fibra em detergente neutro e proteína bruta em 19% e 14%, respectivamente, nas vacas do tratamento com suplementação. Foram observados aumentos de 11,8%; 9,0% e 10,1%, respectivamente, na produção de leite (PL), PL corrigida para gordura e PL corrigida para energia das vacas do tratamento com suplementação. A resposta à suplementação em kg de leite por kg de MS de concentrado fornecido foi de 0,57 e os teores de gordura, proteína e lactose não diferiram entre os tratamentos. A suplementação energética promove o incremento de 12% na produção de leite de vacas Holandês x Gir em pastejo de BRS Kurumi, bem como o aumento na produção de proteína, lactose e sólidos totais no leite. Além disso, o fornecimento de suplementos energéticos para vacas em lactação em pastejo de BRS Kurumi aumenta a eficiência na utilização do nitrogênio da dieta.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41972/29676,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Effects of breeder age and short-term temperature stimulation during incubation on performance, organ weight, and carcass yield in male and female broilers","Birds develop thermoregulatory control during the last days of incubation. Different temperature conditioning programs have been proposed to prepare broiler chicks for post-hatch life. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term temperature (STT) stimulation and breeder age on hatching performance, embryo development, yolk absorption, and post-hatch performance of male and female broilers. A 2 × 2 factorial completely randomized design was used, with two breeder ages (30 and 60 wk), two temperature incubation programs (control and STT), and 2,520 eggs per treatment. Eggs were distributed in two large-scale commercial incubators with a capacity of 120,960 eggs. The control group was subjected to a standard single-stage incubation program (37.2-37.4 °C), whereas the STT group was subjected to a temperature increment of 1 °C for 4 h on embryonic days 16, 17, 18, and 19. Embryos were analyzed at 16 and 19 days of incubation, and chicks at hatch. At 19 days of incubation, STT conditioning resulted in lower yolk sac weight in embryos from 60-wk-old breeders and higher relative weight of the gastrointestinal tract in embryos from 30-wk-old breeders. At hatch, males had lower residual yolk weight, females had greater length, and chicks from 60-wk-old breeders subjected to STT had higher body weight and relative weight of the gastrointestinal tract. Eggs from 30-wk-old breeders showed higher fertility and hatchability and lower infertility, mortality, and second-grade chick percentages. Regarding performance, it was found that males had higher body weight from 7 to 42 days of age and higher whole leg yields. Females, on the other hand, had higher fat yields. Breeder age and sex influenced gastrointestinal tract development, carcass yield, and performance. A 1 °C increase in incubation temperature for 4 h from days 16 to 19 of incubation affected yolk absorption and digestive tract development in chicks from 60-wk-old breeders without, however, influencing performance results.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42026/29677,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Influence of energy supplementation on associative effects in Nellore bulls on a tropical pasture during the rainy season,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of energy supplementation on associative effects between forage and concentrate supplements and on the performance of beef cattle on a tropical pasture during the rainy season. Twenty-eight Nellore bulls averaging 19 months of age and 325.2 ± 4.1 kg were allotted to a completely randomized design and distributed into four paddocks of two hectares each with a tropical pasture for 84 d. The treatments consisted of bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture without concentrate supplementation or bulls on Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraés pasture receiving concentrate supplementation at 15 (S15), 30 (S30) or 45% (S45) of the total digestible nutrients (TDN) requirement. All bulls had ad libitum access to mineral supplementation. The amount and chemical composition of the supplement were adjusted every 28 d. Forage and supplement intakes were evaluated in all animals using fecal markers. Crude protein: digestible organic matter ratio decreased with supplementation; consequently, the imbalance between dietary protein and energy increased. Forage intake decreased with increasing supplementation. The substitution rates of pasture for supplementary feed were 0.14, 0.33, and 0.46 for bulls from S15, S30, and S45 treatments, respectively. However, the apparent DM digestibility increased linearly with supplementation level. Supplementation improved the assimilation of ammonia-N in the rumen. Energy supplementation for Nellore bulls on tropical pastures during the rainy season provides excess energy relative to protein, resulting in a substitution effect of supplement intake on forage intake. Moreover, energy supplementation does not improve body weight gain. Protein sources should be added to supplements for balancing protein and energy levels, thereby reducing a likely substitution effect.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42027/29678,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Mortality of leaf-cutting ants with salicylic acid,"Strategies for the control of leaf-cutting ants have mainly involved granular baits based on fipronil and sulfluramid as active ingredients, which are commonly coated with attractive citrus-based substances. Their constant use and the lack of alternatives in the market may favor the perception of these substances by ants, causing rejection for foraging and consequent difficulty in their control. In this respect, this study examined the mortality of leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex subjected to direct application with dry powders, in laboratory conditions. As a preliminary treatment, a commercial antiseptic talc powder (C. A. P. T.) was used, followed by isolated treatments that corresponded to its components with potential insecticidal action, namely, salicylic acid, sulfur, boric acid, zinc oxide, in addition to an inert talc powder (Quimidrol®) as the control. For each treatment, 40 (worker) ants, whose activity was reduced due to remaining in a refrigerator prior to the treatment, were placed in transparent crystal polystyrene (‘Gerbox’ type) and were sprinkled with a salt shaker. The ants were kept at 25 ± 2 °C, under a 12-h photophase, and cumulative mortality was recorded every 24 h, considering dead ants as those that were unable to maintain the natural position of their body, i.e., even dying ants were considered dead when they exhibited no reaction when touched by a paintbrush. When sprinkled on ants, C. A. P. T. causes 40% mortality in both species 24 h after application. Subsequent studies of the components of this commercial product have found that when sprinkled on both Atta sexdens rubropilosa and Acromyrmex crassispinus, salicylic acid causes 100% mortality of workers in the first 24 h. This result provides a new prospect of control through a low environmental-impact product, representing an alternative for control in nests in the field that can contribute to the integrated control of ants.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41565/29679,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Accelerated aging predicts the emergence of rice seedlings in the field,"Selecting the most appropriate vigor test for rice to predict seedling emergence remains a challenge. This is mainly attributed to the diversity of available tests that evaluate vigor; however, there is a critical need for tests that can show a high correlation with field emergence. Thus, this study aimed to determine which vigor tests are the most efficient in predicting the emergence of rice seedlings, to facilitate correct selection for quality control analyses and pre-sowing for rice seed commercialization. Across two growing seasons, 2016/17 and 2017/18, different seed lots of ‘SCS122 Miura’ rice were subjected to vigor evaluations including germination test, electrical conductivity, cold test, low temperature germination, accelerated aging, root and shoot length, seedling dry weight, emergence speed, and emergence speed index, and greenhouse and field emergence tests. A completely randomized design with four replicates was used for the experiments. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. The germination rate for ‘SCS122 Miura’ seed lots in both growing seasons was greater than 80%. In both growing seasons, unlike the similar results obtained for field emergence, in the laboratory tests, differences were observed between these same seed lots. Electrical conductivity and emergence speed showed a negative correlation with greenhouse and field emergence. The vigor tests for accelerated aging, emergence speed, and dry weight are more efficient in predicting the emergence of rice seedlings. Among the tested methods, accelerated aging (41 °C for 120 h) is one of the most efficient for predicting the emergence of rice seedlings and the best option for laboratory analysis of quality control and pre-sowing owing to its practicality and time required for execution.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40189/29430,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Acetylsalicylic acid increases postharvest longevity of ornamental sunflower inflorescence,"Sunflower to be used in ornamental floral arrangements need to be free from damage, and have longer shelf life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on the postharvest longevity of ornamental sunflower. Floral stems of the cultivar Vicent’s Choice from Sakata Seed were placed in flasks containing 350 mL of solution containing 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, or 1000 mg of ASA per liter of distilled water. Aspirin® (acetylsalicylic acid) tablets were used as the source of salicylic acid. Grades from 0 to 5 were assigned every day, according to a pre-established criteria for assessing the longevity and quality of the inflorescences. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, Tukey's test (t = 0.05%), and regression analysis using Sisvar program. Significant differences were observed in the grades from the sixth to the tenth day of treatment, but not in the total longevity. Treatment with 400 mg L-1 of ASA improved the commercial longevity to an average of 9 days, about 4 days more than the control (0 mg L-1). At 400 mg L-1 dose, ASA prolongs the commercial longevity and maintains the postharvest quality of ornamental sunflower stems. However, at the maximum dose used (1000 mg L-1), the evaluated parameters did not show any improvement over the controls.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40414/29431,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Growth of forage palm cultivars irrigated with saline waters,"Forage palm is considered an important resource in the Brazilian semiarid region. Thus, this study aimed at analyzing different levels of salinity in irrigation water on the growth of three forage palm cultivars. The study was carried out in the Federal University of Campina Grande (7°12’52.56”S; 35°54’22.26”O) in 120 L pots open to the sky. The experiment was a complete randomized block, with 4 replications and a 4x3 factorial arrangement. The treatments consisted of 4 levels of salinity in irrigation water with electrical conductivity of 0.2; 2.0; 3.8 and 5.6 dS m -1; and three forage palm cultivars: Miúda or Doce (Nopalea cochenillifera Salm Dyck), Orelha de Elefante (Opuntia stricta), Baiana or IPA Sertânia (Nopalea cochenillifera Salm Dyck). At 150 days after treatments, it was evaluated: length, width and perimeter of primary and secondary cladodes and total number of cladodes. The variables were submitted to the variance analysis using F-test (p < 0.05) and when some significant effect was found the quadratic regression analysis was applied for the quantitative variable and the Turkey test (p < 0.05) was used for the qualitative variable. Salinity levels in irrigation water did not affect the growth variables. There was a significant difference on the growth of forage palm as a function of its cultivar. The Baiana cultivar showed the highest vegetative growth of length and perimeter of primary and secondary cladode, while Miúda and Orelha de Elefante presented the greatest cladode numbers for plant and cladode width, respectively.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40655/29432,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Osmopriming, antioxidative action, and thermal stress in sunflower seeds with different vigor levels","The osmopriming technique can reduce the period between sowing and the emergence of seedlings in the field, as well as favor seed performance under stress conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of osmopriming on the physiological performance and antioxidative enzymatic activity of sunflower seeds with different vigor levels and exposed to thermal stress. Three sunflower seed lots of the cultivar Hélio 250 were used. Initially, the seeds were evaluated by germination and vigor tests to characterize the lots. Subsequently, they were primed in a polyethylene glycol 6000 solution at -2.0 MPa and 15 °C for 8 h. Then, the primed and unprimed seeds were tested for physiological quality (germination, first germination count, percentage and emergence speed index of seedlings, and seedling dry matter) and determination of the activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase (POX) under three temperatures: 15 °C (sub-optimal), 25 °C (optimal), and 35 °C (supra-optimal). The physiological tests allowed classifying lots 1, 2, and 3 into three different vigor levels, i.e., high, medium, and low, respectively. Osmopriming favored the performance of sunflower seeds in terms of germination and vigor at all the analyzed temperatures. This effect was more pronounced in lots of lower physiological quality at sub-optimal and supra-optimal temperatures. Sub-and supra-optimal temperatures led to a reduction in the physiological performance of seeds, mainly in less vigorous lots. In general, osmopriming favored an increase in the activity of the enzymes SOD, CAT, POX, and APX, mainly in low vigor seeds exposed to sub and supra-optimal temperatures. Osmopriming of sunflower seeds in PEG 6000 at -2.0 MPa for 8 hours is efficient to improve the performance of less vigorous lots under stress due to the sub- and supra-optimal temperatures, favoring an increase in the activity of enzymes of the antioxidative system.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40771/29433,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design was a completely randomised block with eight treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of combinations of four cowpea cultivars, BRS Tumucumaque, BRS Cauamé, BRS Guariba, and BRS Itaim, with two radish cultivars, Crimson Gigante and Zapp. In each block, individual plots of these cultivars in single cultivation were planted as additional treatments to obtain the system indices. The indices of agronomic and economic efficiency and of competition evaluated were land equivalent ratio (LER), actual yield loss (AYL), land use efficiency (LUE%), score of the canonical variable (Z), gross income (GI), net income (NI), rate of return (RR), corrected monetary advantage (CMA), competitive ratio (CR) and the aggressivity of radish over cowpea (Ar) and cowpea over radish (Avc). The cowpea cultivar BRS Tumucumaque, when combined with the radish cultivar Zapp, provided the highest agro-economic efficiency of the intercropped system in a semi-arid environment. The complementarity and sustainability of the intercropping systems of cowpea and radish were observed in the results of the Hsu test applied to the indices of agro-economic efficiency and of competition.

2021,42,Physiological quality of white oat seeds at different temperatures,"White oats are cereals that are grown in different regions of the globe because they have good adaptability and final destination. Thus, their cultivation has shown significant increases in order to meet demand, especially for forage production, grains, and animal and human consumption. High-quality seeds are necessary for crop cultivation and white oats are sown in winter when thermal fluctuations may occur. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological changes in oat seeds exposed to different temperatures during the germination phase. The experiment was a completely randomized design with four replications in a 6 × 4 factorial design. Six cultivars were evaluated: Aphrodite, Altiva, Artemis, Brava, Corona, and Guará at temperatures of 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C, and the following measurements were taken: first germination count, germination, germination speed index (IVG), and seedling length and mass. The results were analyzed using analysis of variance (F test) and the means were compared using Tukey’s test. The cultivars were physiologically affected at the minimum and maximum temperatures. At 15 °C, normal seedlings did not form, whereas the highest germination values were recorded at 20 and 25 ºC, which showed that these temperatures were the most favorable temperatures for the germination process. Vigor declined at 30 °C and there was a greater number of abnormal seedlings and dead seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41391/29435,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Microwave and convective air on drying of Araucaria angustifolia seeds,"Microwave drying has shorter processing times compared with convection drying, which results in high-quality products and reduced energy consumption. The objective of this study is to evaluate the drying process of Araucaria angustifolia seeds using hot air at atmospheric pressure by applying microwaves (300 W and 500 W), and comparing them with the conventional drying process using hot air (80 °C). The drying time using hot air with microwaves at 500 W and 300 W was reduced by 83.33% and 73.89%, respectively, compared with conventional drying. The drying process occurred in the transient regime, with the predominance of a period of decreasing drying rate. The internal temperature of Araucaria seeds increased with the exposure time to the drying process, whereas the moisture content decreased. This tendency was greater for seeds subjected to electromagnetic fields, especially those exposed to higher power. The total phenolic compounds (TPCs) were lower by microwave drying when compared with conventional drying. The TPC loss was influenced by the internal temperature of the seed. Alternative methods to promote the increased retention of phenolic compounds during the drying process include decreasing the microwave power before the end of drying, combining traditional microwave-associated drying methods, and controlling the applied microwave power.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41423/29436,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Physiological quality of parsley seeds in function of size,"Parsley seeds are commercialized without classification by size during processing, unlike other crops. This classification procedure allows the standardization of seed size for high precision in sowing, disposal of unwanted material, and selection of high quality seeds. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of seed size on germination, vigor, and yield performance of two parsley cultivars. Seeds from eight lots of parsley of ‘Portuguesa’ and ‘Chacareira’ cultivar were separated into three size classes, represented by the seeds retained in the sieves of 0.84, 1.00 and 1.41mm mesh opening. After classification, seeds were evaluated in the laboratory for water content, germination percentage, first count, and thousand seed weight. In the field, the fresh and dry weight of aerial part and the final number of plants (stand) were evaluated after 78 days of sowing. The experimental design was the completely randomized design in an 8 x 3 factorial scheme (eight lots and three sieve opening) with four replicates, for both cultivars. Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance and means were compared using Tukey test at 5% probability level. It was concluded that the parsley seeds separated by the 1.41 mm sieves showed higher vigor, and consequently, greater success in stand establishment at the field than those separated by other sieve size. The use of sieves in the classification of parsley seeds helps in obtaining lots with superior physiological quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41464/29437,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Soil catenas in a pilot sub-basin in the region of Itajubá, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, for environmental planning","Systemic studies that allow the environmental characterization of pilot sub-basins are essential to guide their management, which are the basis for adequate environmental planning. The José Pereira sub-basin has an area of approximately 40 km² and is located in the municipality of Itajubá, south of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. This area was chosen as a pilot sub-basin for this study because it holds an important forest remnant, the Serra dos Toledos Biological Reserve, and part of the urban area of the municipality in the process of expansion, as well as a rural area where inappropriate and intensive agricultural activities are practiced. In this scenario, this atudy examined the soil catenas of this sub-basin to serve as an important instrument of planning for this unit. Eight soil catenas distributed into three topo-morphological compartments were studied. According to the generated soil map, Haplic Cambisols occupy 26% of the sub-basin, in mountainous relief; Red and Red-Yellow Latosols, 6% of the area, predominating in the flat-to-undulating relief; Haplic Gleysols, 7% of the area, in the lowlands, in flat relief and at the footslope. Finally, Red and Red-Yellow Argisols were the predominant classes, occurring in almost 50% of the sub-basin, under undulating and strongly undulating reliefs. Based on the combined results, a model of local evolution of the sub-basin soils was proposed: the younger soils, Haplic Cambisol and Haplic Gleysol, occupy the positions of convex top and floodplain, respectively. In the upper and lower thirds of the landscape, the predominance of Red Argisol is related to constant renewal of soil material, preventing it from reaching the latosolic stage. In addition, part of these Argisols has a Bw horizon below Bt horizon in rugged relief. Moreover, in the landscape lower third, Latosols are present, even in areas with steep slope.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41542/30188,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Estimation of buckwheat leaf area by leaf dimensions,"The objective of this work was to model and identify the best models for estimating the leaf area, determined by digital photos, of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) of the cultivars IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar, as a function of length (L), width (W) or length x width product (LW) of the leaf blade. Ten uniformity trials (blank experiments) were carried out, five with IPR91-Baili cultivar and five with IPR92-Altar cultivar. The trials were performed on five sowing dates. In each trial and cultivar, expanded leaves were collected at random from the lower, middle and upper segments of the plants, totaling 1,815 leaves. In these 1,815 leaves, L and W were measured and the LW of the leaf blade was calculated, which were used as independent variables in the model. The leaf area of each leaf was determined using the digital photo method (Y), which was used as a dependent variable of the model. For each sowing date, cultivar and thirds of the plant, 80% of the leaves (1,452 leaves) were randomly separated for the generation of the models and 20% of the leaves (363 leaves) for the validation of the models of leaf area estimation as a function of linear dimensions. For buckwheat, IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars, the quadratic model (Y = 0.5217 + 0.6581LW + 0.0004LW2, R2 = 0.9590), power model (Y = 0.6809LW1.0037, R2 = 0.9587), linear model (Y = 0.0653 + 0.6892LW, R2 = 0.9587) and linear model without intercept (Y = 0.6907LW, R2 = 0.9587) are indicated for the estimation of leaf area determined by digital photos (Y) based on the LW of the leaf blade (x), and, preferably, the linear model without intercept can be used, due to its greater simplicity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41574/29439,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Cost reduction and quality enhancement in passion fruit seedlings using alternative substrate,"Obtaining vigorous, quality seedlings is a complex task because it involves multiple physical, chemical and biological factors, with the substrate being a fundamental of this process. Therefore, this study proposes to evaluate different formulations of substrate mixtures and identify which provides better emergence vigor and shoot and root growth in passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims). The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design consisting of 23 substrates with different proportions of Vivatto® and Osmocote®, washed sand, soil, fine coal, coarse coal, enriched hydrogel and enriched vermiculite, with and without the addition of NPK, which were distributed into four replications of four plants per plot. To enrich the hydrogel and vermiculite, foliar fertilizer was used. Emergence vigor was evaluated throughout the seedling emergence period and seedling growth parameters were observed at 60 days after sowing. The data were subjected to multivariate analysis and the groups formed were subjected to analysis of variance. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), four groups were identified. The group composed only of soil + coarse coal and enriched hydrogel (2:2:1) was considered the best treatment, as it favored most of the vegetative growth and emergence vigor traits. Soil plus sand with the addition of NPK was not recommended to grow passion fruit seedlings in any of the proportions used, as there was no emergence.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41741/29440,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Nutrient dynamics with application of humic substances and liming in irrigated soil filled columns,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the retention of P, K, Ca and Mg nutrients, as well as pH and electrical conductivity in Oxisols. Soil samples were placed into columns, with addition of humic substances (soil with and without liming). The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and the columns consisted of PVC tubes with 40 cm height x 5 cm diameter. The humic substances used were humic acid and fulvic acid, applied at rates of 0, 60, 120 and 240 L ha -1, in soil with or without lime. Ten irrigation events were performed, simulating 32 mm rainfall. After that, samples were collected from the columns, at 0-20 and 20-40 cm depths, to identify the residual effect of the addition of humic substances. A completely randomized design was used for this experiment, with 2×2×4 factorial statistical model and 3 replications. The results showed that, under acidic soil conditions, the use of fulvic acid provides more significant P release (up to 40%) in soil when compared to humic acid. When the rate of 240 L ha -1 is applied, the fulvic acid can release up to 83% of P in the soil.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41875/29441,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Management of clonal mini-garden with gibberellic acid in guava rootstock propagation,"The viability of the mini-cutting technique requires seedling regrow ability and continuous propagule production. It is hypothesized that the application of gibberellic acid (GA) can stimulate vegetation and increase the production of mini-cuttings. The aim of this study was to increase the mini-cutting yield of Psidium guajava (L.) × Psidium guineense (Sw.) (‘BRS Guaraçá’) as a function of foliar application of GA and season of the year. The experiment was laid out in a randomized-block design with split-plots in time, in which the plots consisted of different GA concentrations applied (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg L - 1) and the subplots were represented by two application periods or seasons (summer and winter). Four replicates were used, with two plants per plot. After the seedlings were topped, GA was applied at different concentrations and the emerged shoots were evaluated over 30 days. Mini-stump yield was assessed by collecting and evaluating the potential number of mini-cuttings. Shoot length and mini-stump yield increased linearly with the increasing GA concentrations during the summer. In the winter, this response was quadratic, with optimal concentrations estimated at 65.3 mg L-1 for shoot length and 76 mg L -1 for mini-stump yield. The GA concentration of 200 mg L - 1 provided shorter internodes in the summer, whereas in the winter the use of GA did not interfere with this trait. The increasing applications of GA induced a linear increase in stem diameter at both seasons of the year. Gibberellic acid did not interfere with the rooting of the mini-cuttings. The highest rooting percentage occurred in the summer, with an average of 95%. In the winter, this value was 77.2%, demonstrating that mini-cuttings are a promising technique for ‘BRS Guaraçá’. Foliar spraying of GA promoted an increase in mini-cutting production, without interfering with their rooting.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42070/29442,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Wheat yield and seed physiological quality affected by initial seed vigor, sowing density, and environmental conditions","Optimization of seed density range, combined with the use of quality seeds may help generate more profit from wheat production, as these factors affect grain yield and the quality of seeds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of initial vigor level and sowing densities on the productive performance of the plants and the physiological performance of the seeds of two wheat cultivars in two cultivation environments. The experiment was carried out in the cities of Londrina and Ponta Grossa, Paraná, Brazil, in a randomized block design with four replications, following a 2 × 2 × 4 factorial scheme with two levels of seed vigor (high and low), two cultivars (BRS Gralha-Azul and BRS Sabiá), and four sowing densities (150, 250, 350, and 450 seeds m - 2). The following characteristics were evaluated: emerged seedlings, shoot dry matter, spike density, vegetation index, and grain yield. Additionally, the physiological potential of the seeds produced in Londrina was evaluated by first germination count, germination, accelerated aging, seedling emergence, and emergence speed index tests. The increase in density up to 450 seeds m-2 favored the productive performance of the crop in both cultivation environments; however, it reduced the physiological performance of the seeds produced in Londrina. Both cultivars had better performance and grain yield in Londrina and Ponta Grossa, respectively. High-vigor seeds favored the establishment of the stand, especially under unfavorable environmental conditions.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42134/29443,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The beverages were evaluated for physicochemical and sensory characteristics and their adequacy to the identity and quality standards of whole grape juice. Experiments were carried out in the 2018 and 2019 harvests with the grape cultivars BRS Rúbea (RUB), BRS Cora (COR), BRS Violeta (VIO), BRS Carmem (CAR), BRS Magna (MAG), Bordô (BOR), Isabel (ISA), Isabel Precoce (IP), Concord (CON), Concord Clone 30 (C30) and SCS 421 Paulina (SCSP). Treatments followed factorial design (cultivars x extraction system). S1 resulted in juices with lower soluble solids content; on average, a reduction of 3.12 °Brix in 2018 and 2.30 °Brix compared with the original content in grapes. Among S1 juices, only VIO and MAG in 2018, and VIO and CAR in 2019 achieved the minimum value of soluble solids (14 °Brix) established by the Brazilian legislation. Juices of SCSP and CON in 2018 and C30, CON and RUB in 2019 presented values lower than 14 °Brix, independent of the extraction system. S2 juices were characterized by higher values of total acidity, soluble solids, reducing sugars, anthocyanins, global impression, and equilibrium, as well as lower values of lightness for most of the cultivars.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41823/29444,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Serological markers for hepatitis a among captive and free-living wild mammals in the State of Pará, Brazil","The hepatitis A virus (HAV, Hepatovirus A) in humans has a relevant impact on public health, especially in geographic regions with poor basic sanitation, such as the Brazilian Amazon. Isolates related to hepatoviruses have been described in non human primates, chiropterans, marsupials, rodents, marmots, shrews, and terrestrial hedgehogs. However, the circulation of these viruses in the Amazonian mammal fauna remains unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of antibodies against this hepatovirus in captive and free-living wild mammals belonging to the orders Didelphimorphia, Primates, Carnivora, and Artiodactyla. Serum samples from 71 animals, from three municipalities in the State of Pará (Belém, Santarém, and Capitão-Poço) were tested for total anti-HAV and anti-HAV IgM through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total anti-HAV antibodies were detected in 29.5% (21/71) of non-human primates, 8.4% (6/71) of carnivores, and 5.6% (4/71) of didelphos. All tayassuidos 0% (0/2) were seronegative. Anti-HAV IgM antibodies were not detected in any of the samples tested. The highest total anti-HAV seropositivity in the municipalities studied was in Santarém with 54.24% (12/22), followed by Capitão Poço with 50% (15/30), and then Belém with 21.05% (4/19). Among the seropositive animals, animals kept in exposure cages showed 43.9% (18/41), quarantined animals with 60% (9/15), and free-living animals with 26.6% (4/15). The serological results indicated a profile of previous exposure to hepatovirus among these animals. Therefore, additional studies to characterize HAV-related viruses in captive and free living wild animals need to be conducted to better understand the impact of the circulation of this virus on human and animal health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40147/29445,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Sustainable agriculture: the use of FAMACHA method in Santa Ines sheep in the Semi-arid region of Brazil,"Sheep farming is of great importance in generating income to smallholders in semi-arid areas worldwide. Gastrointestinal helminths cause important damage to the animals with poor welfare conditions, impacting in local economies. The objective of this work was to evaluate the FAMACHA method (FMC) in a herd of 60 Santa Inês from Paraíba, Brazil, and to compare the data from previous production years. In order to determine anemic sheep, FMC chart was used in biweekly evaluations for 12 months by trained personnel. Blood and fecal samples were collected monthly to determine packed cell volume (PCV), and parasite fecal egg count (FEC), respectively. The animals were divided into: dry, pregnant and lactating ewes, lambs and rams. Haemonchus was the predominant helminth genus (94.7%) during the whole year. There were up to 97% of success on the interpretation of FMC with 90 to 100% efficacy in the treatment decision. Among the 1356 evaluations, in only 40 (3%) were required deworming, being 27 during the rainy season and 13 during the long dry season. A statistically significant correlation (P < 0.01) was observed between FEC and PCV for the dry, lactating, and pregnant categories. The data reports a 94% reduction in deworming, with a greater need for anthelmintic use in lambs and lactating ewes (P < 0.05). Our data validates the use of FMC in Santa Inês sheep, which is considered a local resilient breed in the semi-arid region of Brazil.

2021,42,"Occurrence of anti Sarcocystis spp., anti Toxoplasma gondii, and anti Neospora spp. antibodies in equines from western Santa Catarina, Brazil","Equine raising is generally articulated as a secondary activity on farms, where animals are used for leisure or work. Thus, it is important to consider the health of these animals, seeking to understand which are the main agents that circulate in a given farm or region. In this sense, this study aimed to evaluate the presence of IgG anti-Sarcocystis spp., anti-Toxoplasma gondii, and anti-Neospora spp. antibodies in equines in western Santa Catarina, Brazil. A total of 100 serum samples from horses from 10 farms, located in the municipalities of Faxinal dos Guedes, Xaxim, and Xanxerê were analyzed from June to December 2019. The samples were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence reaction (IIFR) to detect antibodies of IgG class against the three agents. The results showed that the equines in the region are seropositive against the three studied agents, 11% of which for Sarcocystis spp. 21% for T. gondii, and 20% for Neospora spp. The analysis of the presence of these protozoa in different environments showed that both stabled and extensively raised horses presented signs of contact with the studied agents. Animals that live only in stables had a higher occurrence of IgG anti-Sarcocystis (7/32; 21.88%) and anti-T. gondii (11/32; 34.38%) antibodies. The evaluating of animals raised on pasture, semi-extensively and extensively, showed a higher percentage of seropositivity for N. caninum (9/34; 26.47%). The high occurrence of animals seropositive to the studied protozoa reinforces the importance of controlling and preventing these agents in the region, as they have the potential to cause a high impact on equid farming, mainly involving reproductive losses and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41066/29488,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Glyphosate in the production and forage quality of marandu grass,"The drift of the herbicide glyphosate, used for desiccating crops or controlling weeds, can result in growth-promoting or non-target plant development effects. Thus, it is possible to use the compound to increase the biomass of forage through the hormone effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal doses of glyphosate on the production of Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu (Marandu grass) and its nutritional quality in ruminants. The design used was completely randomized, with five replications in a factorial scheme. The treatments used were as follows: control (without glyphosate application) and four sublethal doses of glyphosate (4, 10, 14, and 20 g ha-1 of the acid equivalent). The monthly collections consisted of collecting the plant material (0.20 m) from the surface, comprising of leaves and pseudocolmos (stem and leaf sheath) to determine the dry matter production and forage chemical-bromatological parameters. The results showed that leaf/stem ratio, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were affected exclusively by the harvest factor. The hormone effect of the herbicide occurs in the production of dry matter and lignin in the evaluated subdoses. For crude protein, there was an interaction between the factor doses and harvest, due to the effect of glyphosate and the management applied to the harvests, showing that the sublethal doses of glyphosate promoted the production of dry matter and the food quality of Marandu grass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39882/29450,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Ruminal parameters and in-situ degradability of rations with wheat middling substitution for corn,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of substituting corn with wheat middling on the in-situ degradability of foods and ruminal parameters of cattle. The experiment was conducted at the Ruminant Studies Unit and the Laboratory of Food Analysis and Animal Nutrition of Londrina State University. Five rumen-fistulated cattle with an average weight of 521 ± 38.22 kg were housed in individual stalls. The experimental design used was a Latin square with five treatments (100% C, 75% C 25% WM, 50% C 50% WM, 25% C 75% WM, and 100% WM) and five periods of 25 days each. The pH and ammoniacal nitrogen (N-NH3) concentration in ruminal fluid was measured before feeding and 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after feeding in subdivided parcels. The in-situ degradability of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were determined by incubating silage samples and measuring concentrates in the rumen of cattle. The levels of substitution of corn by wheat middling did not alter the pH and N-NH3 values but was influenced by the collection time. The N-NH3 presented quadratic behavior with a point of maximum rumen concentration (5.31 mgdL-1) reached 1.12 h after feeding. The pH presented quadratic behavior with a point of minimum (6.04) reached 4.32 h after feeding. The effective degradability (ED) of DM with 2, 5 and 8%h-1 of passage rate was influenced by the substitution of corn by wheat middling, with increasing linear behavior. The ED 2%h-1 varied from 46.19% to 50.24%, the ED 5%h-1 varied from 33.76% to 38.68%, and the ED 8%h-1 values ranged from 28.16% to 32.92% for the 100% C and 100% WM treatments. Higher values, for treatments with higher levels of substitution of corn by wheat middling, occurred owing to the lower fiber content and to the largest soluble fractions and degradation rate of DM in rations with wheat middling. The ED of CP and NDF with passage rates of 2, 5 and 8%h-1 presented quadratic behavior. The ED 2, 5 and 8%h-1 of CP presented maximums of 75.9%, 77.9%, and 86.2%, with averages of 52.02%, 45.93%, and 42.23%, respectively. The ED 2, 5 and 8%h-1 of NDF presented minimum points of 29.6%, 34.7%, and 35.2%, with averages of 41.60%, 33.43%, and 27.76%, respectively. Wheat middling can be used for total substitution of corn without damaging ruminal pH and N-NH3, in addition to improving the degradability of rations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40092/29547,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Serum biochemical reference ranges for lambs from birth to 1 year of age in the tropics,"The study aimed to determine the biochemical reference ranges for lambs from birth to 1 year of age in the tropics. Data were obtained from experiments performed in several institutions and commercial farms using Santa Inês, Dorper, Lacaune, Morada Nova, Bergamacia and Suffolk lambs reared under different conditions (grazing, feedlot, semi-feedlot) from 2006 to 2017. Serum energy-, protein-, mineral-, and enzyme-related metabolites were evaluated. The metabolic energy profile included data from glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, fructosamine, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; the metabolic protein profile included total protein, uric acid, urea, albumin, and creatinine; the metabolic mineral profile included data on calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium; and the metabolic enzymatic profile included the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatine kinase. The reference ranges were estimated using confidence intervals with a 95% confidence level, and percentiles were estimated or bootstrapped nonparametrically when the data were not normally distributed. The serum biochemical reference ranges determined for lambs are strongly divergent from those established by one of the most cited books on the topic, especially considering the high serum urea and cholesterol concentrations and low levels of blood glucose observed. Therefore, the serum biochemical reference ranges for lambs from birth to 1 year of age in the tropics differ from international data, which consider adult sheep in temperate climate zones.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41045/29452,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Impact of environmentally friendly technologies on costs and cost-effectiveness of a dairy cattle confinement system,"Our goal was to assess the economic impact of some environmentally friendly technologies on the production costs and cost-effectiveness of a dairy cattle confinement system, estimating environmental costs and their representativeness in both effective and total operating costs, as well as in the total cost. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the cost center of milk production and identified the components that most affect final costs, estimating a break-even point (kg milk year-1) as well. The data were collected in a freestall full-confinement system of a dairy cattle farm located in southern Minas Gerais State (Brazil), from January 2016 to December 2017. The cost of milk production was estimated using a method based on the operating and total costs from a cost center involving lactating and dry dairy cows. The cost center of milk production showed to be economically feasible, showing positive gross and net margin results, as well as positive profitability and cost-effectiveness. Total environmental operating cost was on average R$ 0.015 per kg milk, which represented 1.985% of the total operating cost. Effective environmental operating cost was on average R$ 0.0059, which corresponded to 0.7788% of the total operating cost. Finally, total environmental cost was on average R$ 0.0317, representing 3.3280% of the total cost. The most representative items of the effective operating cost were in descending order: animal feed, workforce, animal health, animal production hormone (bovine somatotropin; bST), vehicle maintenance, machines and equipment, maintenance of improvements, electricity, and freestall bedding sand. Average break-even point was 1,104,038.54 kg milk year-1 or 3,024.76 kg milk day-1, while average production was 4,271,383.00 kg milk year-1 and 11,702.42 kg milk day-1.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41047/29495,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Sources of conjugated linoleic acid and lauric acid inoculated into the eggs of quails and its effects on immunity,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of in-egg inoculation with sources of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and lauric acid (AL), going by the weight of lymphoid organs and the biochemical profile of the blood of cut quails, from one to 35 days of age. We used 360 quails distributed in a completely randomized design, in six treatments and six replicates of 10 birds per plot. Corn oil (OM) was used to dilute the CLA and AL. The experimental treatments were: healthy eggs (control); eggs inoculated with OM thinner; eggs inoculated with CLA 120 mg / 50 mL OM; eggs inoculated with CLA 240 mg / 50 mL OM; eggs inoculated with AL 60 mg / 50 mL OM and eggs inoculated with AL 90 mg / 50 mL OM. The results were analyzed through Program R at the level of 5% significance. To verify the normal distribution of errors, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test was applied. At 21 days, an effect of p < 0.05 was observed for the total blood cholesterol content, inoculations with CLA reduced, even as AL increased, regardless of the level. At 35 days, it was found (p < 0.05) that the levels of total cholesterol and AST in the blood decreased with inoculations of CLA and AL at the lower levels, compared to those that did not receive the inoculations. The CLA and AL levels supplemented via egg inoculations did not interfere with the weight of the lymphoid organs (thymus, Fabricius bursa) of the birds, at both ages. Supplementation in eggs of cut quails with CLA 240 mg reduced the total blood cholesterol content compared to CLA 120 mg, at 21 days of age. At 35 days of age, higher concentrations of CLA and AL increased the total cholesterol and AST in the blood of birds and AL had a greater effect on the increase than CLA.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41086/29454,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Characteristics of carcass and non-carcass components of lambs fed wet brewery waste as a roughage feed,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of including wet brewery waste (WBW) as the exclusive dietary roughage source on the characteristics of carcass and non-carcass components of feedlot-finished lambs. Thirty-two non-castrated male lambs weaned at 50 days of age, resulting from the cross between the Texel and Ile de France breeds, were used. The diet was constituted by roughage (WBW) and a concentrate composed of crushed maize, soybean meal, limestone and common salt. Treatments consisted of four levels of WBW as the roughage source in the diet (% dry matter), namely, 31, 44, 57 and 70%. Lambs were slaughtered upon reaching 34 kg live weight. The treatments resulted in a linear decrease in hot and cold carcass weights and yields, carcass compactness index, conformation, degree of fatness and rib-eye area. Among the primal cuts, the absolute weights of pallet, ribs and legs decreased as the WBW level was increased. As to the non-carcass components, only the total gastrointestinal content increased linearly with WBW. The increasing levels of WBW led to greater fasting losses and reduced carcass weights and yields. There was also a reduction in the degree of fatness, carcass compactness, carcass conformation index and rib-eye area Wet brewery waste at the concentration of 31% as the roughage source in the diet of finishing lambs in the feedlot provides better carcass traits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41357/29455,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Genetic variability in Tambaqui generations of the breeding program in the Central-West Region of Brazil,"The implementation of fish breeding programs in Brazil has brought significant results in the productivity of tilapia. However, the insertion of native species with great potential (such as Tambaqui Colossoma macropomum) in these programs is still recent, and thus requires genetic information for monitoring and enabling their consolidation into the programs. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of the parental generation (G0) and two consecutive generations (G1 and G2) in the C. macropomum genetic improvement program, located in the municipality of Sorriso, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Ninety caudal fin samples were collected (30 samples per generation) for DNA extraction. The genetic study implemented seven microsatellite markers (Cm1A8, Cm1A11, Cm1D1, Cm1E3, Cm1F4, Cm1F5, and Cm1H8). A total of 17 alleles were amplified, with variations in the mean number between four to two alleles per locus. The size per locus ranged from 170 to 360 bp. The average inbreeding coefficient was 0.126 (G0), -0.040 (G1), and 0.131 (G2). No null or exclusive alleles were found. The observed heterozygosity values for G1 and G2 demonstrated the preservation of genetic variability (0.453 and 0.409, respectively). In conclusion, the genetic diversity of the parental generation (G0) and the two progenies generations (G1 and G2) were adequate, which demonstrates that the genetic improvement program was conducted correctly; however, it is important to continue to evaluations the genetic diversity of the future progeny.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41486/29456,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Feedlot-finishing lambs with different levels of soybean pre-cleaning by-product as the roughage source,"An experiment was conducted in the Sheep Farming Laboratory at the Federal University of Santa Maria to examine the effect of different levels of replacement of sorghum silage with soybean pre-cleaning by-product (SPCB) on nutrient intake, performance and feeding behavior; as well as to undertake an economic analysis of feeding finishing lambs in a feedlot system. The study involved 32 uncastrated Texel × Ile de France crossbred male lambs weaned at 60 days of age. Treatments consisted of diets in which the roughage source (sorghum silage) was replaced with SPCB at the levels of 0, 33.5, 66.5 or 100% (DM basis). A 45:55 roughage:concentrate ratio was used (DM basis). The diets were composed of a roughage feed based on sorghum silage and/or SPCB, and a concentrate consisting of crushed maize, soybean meal and limestone. In addition, mineral salt was freely available to the animals. The lambs were slaughtered upon reaching the pre-established live weight of 35 kg. Intake on a DM basis showed a quadratic response (P < 0.05) in all forms it was evaluated and expressed, except for the NDF fraction, which increased linearly (P < 0.05) with SPCB inclusion. Average daily weight gain was not significantly influenced (P > 0.05) by the different SPCB levels, averaging 292 g/day. As regards the feeding behavior characteristics evaluated, the number of daily feeding bouts increased linearly (P < 0.01) with the SPCB content of the diets. Total feed cost decreased linearly (P < 0.01), whereas the profit per kilogram of gain and profit obtained per day in the feedlot period increased linearly (P < 0.01) with SPCB inclusion. The use of soybean pre-cleaning by-product as the roughage source in the finishing of feedlot lambs proved to be a viable alternative in both the productive and economic terms.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41523/29457,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Evaluation of antioxidants on oxidative stability and fatty acid profile of poultry offal oil used in the pet food industry,"The current study aimed to evaluate the use of antioxidants on the oxidative stability of poultry oil used in the pet food industry. Five synthetic commercial antioxidants and two natural ones were used: Control (CON); CON + (BHT+BHA+ETO95); CON + (BHT+BHA); CON + (BHA+PG+AC); CON + (BHT+BHA+ETO70); CON + BHA; CON + (ASC+ Rosemary); CON + (ASC+ Tocopherols)). The inclusion was 0.5% for synthetics antioxidants and 0.625% for natural antioxidants. The determination of oxidative stability was done in three temperatures (90 ° C, 110 ° C and 130 ° C). For the determination of the fatty acid profile, the original sample of the poultry oil was considered as a negative control. The determination of the fatty acids was based on the preparation of the methyl esters by transesterification reaction with methanol in an alkaline medium, followed by analysis by gas chromatography. The identification of the different fatty acids was obtained by comparing the retention times of standards of fatty acid methyl ester with retention times of peaks observed. An analysis of compositional data was performed. It was possible to observe that, without using a reliable antioxidant, the induction time is shorter, resulting in a lower oxidative stability of the viscera oil, with consequent loss of its quality, due to less time spent to oxidize. The antioxidants used in CON + (BHT + BHA + ETO95), CON + (BHA + PG + AC) and CON + BHA, preserved more essential fatty acids (linolenic and linoleic). Natural antioxidants had higher oxidation, with higher proportions of saturated fatty acids and the worst ?6: ?3 ratios. It is concluded that the synthetic antioxidants used in CON + (BHT + BHA + ETO95), CON + (BHA + PG + AC) and CON + BHA provided greater protection against oxidation and better preserved essential fatty acids. Natural antioxidants, in the present study, did not present satisfactory protection.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41543/29459,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Salinity-water levels on productive performance, physiological and behavioral responses of 1/2 Dorper x 1/2 Santa Inês crossbred sheep","The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of four water salinity levels on productive performance, physiological and behavioral responses of confined sheep. Thus, 24 crossbred sheep, 1/2 Dorper x 1/2 Santa Inês were evaluated while receiving ration and water ad libitum. The experimental design was completely randomized, composed of four treatments (1.5; 3.0; 6.0 and 9.0 dSm -1) and six replicates. The water supply with salinity of up to 9.0 dSm -1 did not affect (P > 0.05) the physiological indexes, performance, or ingestive behavior of the animals, which were able to maintain normal physiological conditions even at times when the thermal comfort indexes were above the ideal. For voluntary water consumption, it was observed that there was a significant difference between treatments (P < 0.05), where animals consuming water with a conductivity of 1.5; 3.0 dSm -1 had lower consumption than those who received six dSm-1. The supply of water with a salinity of up to 9.0 dSm -1 did not affect the performance or the ingestive behavior of the animals, so waters with this salinity can be a valid alternative for crossbred sheep in the semi-arid region, as long as it is used seasonally and strategically.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41567/29460,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effects of microbial inoculant and fibrolytic enzymes on fermentation quality and nutritional value of BRS capiaçu grass silage,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of bacterial-enzymatic inoculants with different concentrations of fibrolytic enzymes on the fermentation quality and nutritional value of the silage of BRS capiaçu grass. Two bacterial-enzymatic inoculants with different levels of enzyme complex were evaluated (Silotrato® (5%) and Biotrato® (8%)) and control silage (without additive) according to a completely randomized design with eight replicates. To evaluate the silage aerobic stability, a completely randomized split plot design was used with three treatments (plots) and seven times after opening (subplots). There was no interaction between treatments and times after opening on values of pH (P=0.79). Regarding bacterial-enzymatic inoculants, the silage pH was 21.66% and 16.16% higher in silage without additive (mean of 6.00) compared to silage with 5% and 8% enzyme complex (P < 0.01). There was no difference between treatments on pH (P = 0.08), lactic acid (p = 0.08) and acetic acid (p = 0.64), means of 3.11, 47.31 g dry matter (DM)-1 and 11.19 g DM-1, respectively. There was no difference between treatments for any of the chemical composition variables (P = 0.86). Mean values for DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and total digestible nutrients were 22.31%, 6.65%, 71.15% and 42.07%, respectively. There was a higher concentration of butyric acid in the control silage compared to Silotrato® silage. The control silage and silage treated with Biotrato® presented effluent losses (P = 0.05) 13.99% higher than silage with Silotrato®.

2021,42,Short-term changes in plasma and milk fatty acid profiles in cows fed chopped elephant grass-based diets containing two types of sunflower oil associated with two methods of concentrate feeding,"The study was carried out in a randomized block design, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with the aim to evaluating during 21 days the short-term changes in plasma and milk fatty acid (FA) profile in Holstein x Gyr cows (444±84 kg; 75±31 days in milk; 15.4±4.8 kg day-1 of milk) fed 600 g kg-1 DM chopped elephant grass-based diets supplemented with 45 g kg-1 DM sunflower oil (SO). Two types of SO were evaluated: high oleic/low linoleic acid (HO) and medium oleic/medium linoleic acid (MO). The concentrates containing the SO were supplied separately from the forage twice a day (TAD) or as part of a total mixed ration (TMR). Temporal changes were analyzed by mixed models (P<0.05) using six, four and seven repeated measures over time for FA intake, plasma and milk FA composition, respectively. There was higher oleic acid intake in HO SO-fed cows while higher linoleic and ?-linolenic acids intake was observed in MO SO-fed cows. The TAD-fed cows had higher plasma vaccenic acid content than TMR-fed cows, while MO SO-fed cows had higher plasma vaccenic and rumenic acid contents than HO-fed cows. As a function of the day, there were linear increases for oleic and linoleic acids intake, plasma contents of oleic, vaccenic and linoleic acids, and milk fat content of linoleic acid, while quadratic effects were adjusted for milk fat contents of palmitic, oleic, vaccenic and rumenic acids. In comparison with TMR-fed cows, the milk fat of TAD-fed cows produced between days 13-17 showed a FA profile more nutritionally desirable for human health with lower contents of hypercholesterolemics FAs and higher contents of oleic, rumenic and vaccenic acids. Between days 15-16, the vaccenic and rumenic acids contents in milk fat of MO SO-fed cows were 81% higher than that obtained from HO SO-fed cows, which on the 14th day, had 14% higher oleic acid content in milk fat. Lower milk fat level of hypercholesterolemic FAs was produced between days 13-14 by cows fed with both types of SO.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41630/29462,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Addition of homoeopathy in the diet of Japanese quails increases egg weight,"This study aims to evaluate the effects of the inclusion of different homoeopathic products on the diet of laying quails. We used 200 Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) distributed in a completely randomized design consisting of the adoption of four experimental diets, with eight replicates of five quails each. The treatments were control (without additives), calcium carbonate (vehicle used in the products), Fertsigo®, and Ovosigo®. We determined the performance, egg quality, and blood biochemical profile of quails. The data were submitted to Tukey test at 5% probability. There was a significant effect of the homeopathic products Fertsigo® and Ovosigo® on the variables egg weight, yolk, albumen, and shell percentage. It did not affect the performance and blood biochemical profile (p > 0.05). The addition of the homoeopathic product Ovosigo® and FertSigo® in diets of Japanese quails at the laying phase is recommended because they resulted in the better weight of the egg and its components. Thus, the application of homoeopathy in the production of quails is a viable practice, since it is easy to manage, has a reduced cost, and exerts positive effects on the performance of quails.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41646/29463,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experimental design used randomized blocks, composed of three treatments, namely: T1 - corn silage preserved with double-sided polyethylene of 110 µm thickness (conventional seal); T2 - corn silage preserved with double-sided polyethylene of 200 µm thickness (double-sided); and T3 - corn silage preserved with oxygen-impermeable film composed of double-sided polyethylene of 80 µm thickness on a translucent vacuum polyamide film of 20 µm thickness (double sealing), with four repetitions each. The use of double-sided polyethylene with 200 µm thickness (double-sided) and oxygen impermeable film composed of double-sided polyethylene and polyamide (double sealing), were effective in preserving the chemical composition, fermentation profile, raw protein composition and fiber quality, in addition, the use of these polymers resulted in greater ruminal digestibility of dry matter and reduced the pH, temperature, temperature gradient and physical losses of corn silage from the feed out face (ramp) of trench silos compared to the conventional sealing.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41864/29464,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Nutrient production in pastures of Triticale BRS Saturno submitted to different levels of nitrogen in topdressing,"Pastures are a primary source of feed for ruminants, which convert fibrous plants into nutritionally valuable foods for humans, such as meat and milk. However, it is important to understand the nutrient content of different fodder crops for ruminants and its effect on meat, milk, and milk products. We aimed to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilizer doses in topdressing on nutrient production in pastures of Triticale BRS Saturno. The experimental design was a randomized block with five replications. Descriptive statistics of yields per hectare were determined, and a simple linear regression was carried out at the level of 5% significance. The different nitrogen topdressing rates (0, 50, and 100 kg N ha-1) influenced the production (P < 0.05) of dry matter, total carbohydrates, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, crude protein, soluble protein, insoluble protein in neutral and acid detergent, protein degradability, ether extract, linoleic and linolenic fatty acids, neutral detergent fiber digestibility after incubation for 24, 30, and 48 h, and the neutral detergent fiber degradation rate. The different doses of nitrogen fertilizer in topdressing in the form of urea increased nutrient production in pastures of Triticale BRS Saturno, mainly in relation to total carbohydrates and neutral and acid detergent fiber. To a lesser extent, it also significantly interfered with the production of nitrogenous constituents and fatty acids.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41964/29465,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Fermentation characteristics and nutritive value of sweet sorghum silage with Paiaguas palisadegrass and Ipypora grass,"Ensiling sorghum with tropical forages has been shown to be a promising alternative for ruminant feed production, as this approach improves the quality of the sorghum silage. In this context, the goal of this study was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics and nutritive value of sweet sorghum silage made with different levels of Paiaguas palisadegrass and Ipypora grass. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized 2 x 6 factorial design with four replications. Two forages (Paiaguas palisadegrass and Ipypora grass) were added to sorghum at six levels (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%), for a total of 48 experimental silos. After 50 days of fermentation, the silos were opened, and the fermentation profile and chemical composition of the silage were analysed. The results showed that the addition of Paiaguas palisadegrass and Ipypora grass to the sorghum silage increased the pH, buffering capacity and NH3-NT of the silage and reduced its dry matter content but did not affect its fermentation characteristics, which remained within an appropriate range. The addition of increasing levels of Paiaguas palisadegrass and Ipypora grass to the sorghum silage increased the crude protein and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of the silage and decreased the fibre fraction (neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and lignin) and ether extract contents. Adding tropical forages to sorghum silage material at levels above 40% is recommended. Among forage crops, addition of Paiaguas palisadegrass to sorghum silage resulted in higher content of crude protein and IVDMD. Mixed silages can be an effective alternative to improve the quality of forage sorghum silage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41988/29568,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Physiological and behavioral responses of feedlot sheep with and without access to artificial shade,"Artificial shading is widely used to provide thermal comfort to animals and has been extensively researched due to its relationship with their welfare and performance. This study examines the physiological and behavioral traits of sheep in a feedlot system with and without access to shade. Twenty male Santa Inês × Dorper crossbred sheep with an initial average weight of 25 kg were used in the experiment. The animals were kept in two collective stalls, one of which was equipped with a polypropylene mesh shade net with 80% light interception capacity. The experiment was conducted in the feedlot of the Fazenda Escola farm at UEG, São Luís de Montes Belos Campus, state of Goiás, Brazil. Environmental indices (ambient temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index), respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT) and surface temperature (ST) were measured once weekly and behavioral assessments were performed one day after the physiological assessment, between 07h00 and 19h00. The following behaviors were evaluated: feeding, rumination, rest/sleep, social, play and anomalous activities. There were no significant differences for the analyzed variables and treatments. Animals with access to shade had the following physiological results: RR - 75.06 mov. min-1; ST - 33.03 ºC; and RT - 39.21 ºC. Those without access to shade, in turn, showed the following indices: RR - 81.52 mov. min-1; ST - 33.45 ºC; and RT - 39.43 ºC.

Twenty-five castrated male Santa Inês sheep, with an average body weight of 49.6 + 9.4 kg, were used in a completely randomised design. The trial was carried out in an individual open-flow respirometry chamber for small ruminants, with each animal remaining for 24 hours inside the chamber. Gross energy and net energy intake were not affected by adding the cake. Digestible energy intake and metabolisable energy intake showed a linear response, ranging from 145.44 to 178.40 and from 121.85 to 158.08 kcal kg-0.75 day-1 respectively. The energy lost through faeces and methane (% of gross energy intake, GEI) showed decreasing linear behaviour, while the caloric increase, in %GEI, showed a quadratic response. The values for digestible energy and metabolisability presented an increasing linear response. The partial efficiency of use of metabolisable energy for maintenance ranged from 0.71 to 0.81, and showed a quadratic response; however, the net energy values did not differ. For every 10 g of added by-product, there was a reduction of 0.31 g of methane per kg of DM intake. The addition of babassu cake to replace up to 350 g kg-1 DM in sheep diets increases the energy efficiency of the diet and reduces methane emission by the animals.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42157/29469,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Chemical composition and fatty acid profile of BRS Capiaçu ensiled at different regrowth ages,"This study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and fatty acid (FA) profile of chopped forage and silage of BRS Capiaçu elephant grass at four regrowth ages: 50, 70, 90 and 110 days. A randomized block design with five replications was used. The ensiling was carried out manually in experimental silos without wilting using no additives or bacterial inoculants. The results were analyzed using mixed models (P smaller 0.05). The model included treatment (regrowth age) as a fixed effect and block as a random effect. Linear and quadratic effects of the treatments were analyzed using orthogonal contrasts. There were linear increases in the dry matter (DM, g kg -1) and lignin (g kg -1 DM) contents and linear reductions in the in vitro DM digestibility (g kg -1) of chopped grass and silage as a function of regrowth age (P smaller 0.001). Quadratic effects (P smaler 0.01) were observed for the chopped grass contents (g kg-1 DM) of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) as a function of regrowth age. There were linear decreases (P smaler 0.0001) in the CP content (g kg-1 DM) and pH and linear increases (P smaler 0.001) in the EE and NDF contents (g kg-1 DM) in the silage as a function of regrowth age. There were linear decreases (P smaler 0.01) in the chopped grass contents and linear increases (P smaler 0.05) in the silage contents of total FAs, linoleic and alfa-linolenic acids (g kg-1 DM) as a function of regrowth age. BRS Capiaçu elephant grass must be harvested at up to 70 days of regrowth to obtain forage with good nutritional value and the highest levels of linoleic and alfa-linolenic acids (g kg-1 DM).

Total phenolic compounds and total tannin for green tea extract were 20.3% and 14.8% of dry matter (DM), respectively, and for black tea were 18.7% and 12.7% of dry matter, respectively. The addition of green and black tea waste extracts reduced both gas production during incubation hours and dry matter degradability (DMD) in the diet (p < 0.05). A significantly reduced ruminal dry matter disappearance (p < 0.05) and a significantly increased post-ruminal dry matter disappearance (p < 0.05) were observed by adding black and green tea waste extracts. According to the results, the dry matter disappearance throughout the gastrointestinal tract was not significantly different between treatments. It can generally be concluded that the addition of phenolic compounds can be used depending on the nutritional strategy, such as reducing ruminal degradability and increasing rumen nutrient escape.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42743/29491,E-ISSN 1679-0359

However, there are few studies on the biochemical traits and antioxidant capacity of the pulp of these species, which can to contribute to pitaya breeding programs for fresh consumption and processing industrial. The sugars and organic acids were extracted, subsequently, separated and quantified in a chromatographic system. Quantitation of total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity was performed by spectrophotometric analysis using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the DPPH radical scavenging, respectively. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test. H. undatus presented 9.83% of total sugars, distributed as 4.75% of glucose and 5.08% of fructose. Total sugar concentration for S. megalanthus was 5.93%, with 0.99, 3.25 and 1.69% for glucose, fructose and sucrose, respectively, being the only one specie to had sucrose. The concentrations of organic acids for the species H. costaricensis, H. undatus and S. megalanthus were: 0.83, 0.71 and 0.62% for malic acid, and 0.37, 0.36 and 0.40% for citric acid, respectively. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was not detected in the pulps. H. costaricensis had the highest content of total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, 33.75 mg GAE 100 g-1 and 175.51 ?mol TEAC 100 g-1, respectively. Thus, the consumption of S. megalanthus fruits is recommended for people who require carbohydrate-restricted diets, although sensory seems to be the sweetest pulp among them probably due sucrose presence.

2021,42,Sulfonamide resistance genes in soils treated with waste from animal production in an organic production system,"Animal waste is widely used in organic production systems. However, these residues can increase antimicrobial determinants in the soil. In this perspective, this study was developed to evaluate the presence of sulfonamide resistance genes in soils from an organic production system that received animal waste as organic fertilizer. Soil samples were collected from four properties with different management practices to increase soil fertility. Three properties use the animal waste from the conventional system and the other use plant residues as soil cover and a legal reserve. The extraction of total DNA from soil was carried out followed by the amplification of genes encoding sulfonamide resistance (sul1 and sul2) by the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technique. The sul1 and sul2 genes were detected only in soils treated with animal waste. The genes were not detected in soils from the legal reserve and the property that used plant residues as soil cover. These results indicate that the use of animal waste as agricultural fertilizer can increase genes for resistance to antimicrobials in the soil and the composting process may not be enough to eliminate them. This information reiterates the need to implement standards that establish quality parameters for animal waste, considering resistance to antimicrobials, as well as the development of management strategies that reduce the risk of spreading resistance to antimicrobials when these residues are applied to soils.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40859/29473,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Seven measurements of IOP were assessed on the same day (at 6:00 am, 9:00 am, 12:00 am, 3:00 pm, 6:00 pm, 9:00 pm and 00:00 pm). A t-test was used when there were two groups of comparisons and ANOVA was used to detect differences in IOP between measurement times and between age categories. The average IOP was 28.4 ± 3.7 mmHg for all eyes. The mean IOP for Groups I, II and III were 29.2 ± 3.5, 28.4 ± 4.3 and 27.7 ± 3.2 mmHg, respectively. There was no statistically difference between right and left eyes. There was a significant difference between Group I and Group III (P = 0.008). There were no statistically significant differences between measurements recorded at different times of the day (P = 0.560). The IOP was not influenced by the circadian rhythm, but older horses showed reduced IOP.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40044/29475,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Histopathological alterations caused by monogenean parasites the gills of tambaqui Colossoma macropomum (Serrasalmidae),"Monogeneans are ectoparasites of fish with a global distribution. In farmed fish, high infestations may result in morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the histopathological effects of three species of monogeneans Anacanthorus spathulatus, Notozothecium janauachensis and Mymarothecium boegeri on the gills of farmed Colossoma macropomum. Parasitological indices revealed a prevalence of 100%, and a mean abundance of 81.3 ± 11.8. This infection caused displacement of the gill epithelium, focal hyperplasia of epithelial cells, lamellar fusion, congestion and shortening of the secondary lamellae of gills, in addition a complete fusion of the secondary lamellae. However, these tissue alterations were reversible and punctually located lesions, which may not compromise the normal functioning of gills. Lastly, this study showed the potential damages caused by parasite monogeneans to gills of infested fish, thus sanitary management is essential for the growth of fish farm of C. macropomum.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40465/29476,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Evaluation of mathematical models to describe lamb growth during the pre-weaning phase,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of different mathematical models to describe the growth of lambs during the pre-weaning phase and the effect of sex on their growth curve. Data from 51 lambs (26 males and 25 females) with a genetic constitution of at least 50% Santa Inês breed were used. Lamb weight was monitored during the entire pre-weaning phase (91 days) by weighing the animals weekly on a scale suitable for sheep, to draw the body-weight growth curve. The adequacy of the models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination, simultaneous F-test for parameter identity, concordance correlation coefficient, root mean square error of prediction and decomposition of the mean square error of prediction. Pairwise mean square error of prediction analysis and delta Akaike information criterion were used to compare the models in terms of accuracy and precision. The evaluation of the adequacy of the tested models showed that the data predicted by the linear, quadratic and exponential models were similar (P > 0.05) to the observed data. In contrast, the monomolecular model generated predictions that could not be accepted as true. The linear and quadratic models showed better accuracy and precision. The first-degree linear model should be preferred over the other studied models to describe growth of sheep in the pre-weaning phase. Males and females exhibited distinct growth patterns.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40055/29478,E-ISSN 1679-0359

This brief review discusses aspects related to epidemiology, etiologic agents, clinical and pathological manifestations, and challenges in the diagnosis of BRD in Brazil. The main infectious disease agents associated with respiratory outbreaks in cattle from Brazil are bovine alphaherpesvirus type 1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and Mycoplasma bovis. Ovine gammaherpesvirus-2 and HoBi-like pestivirus have been associated with the development of pneumonia in adult cattle and calves, respectively in Brazil, and should be considered as possible causes of BRD. Additionally, studies using epidemiological data, histopathological and molecular associations with morbidity and mortality should be carried out in Brazil, to demonstrate the real impacts of BRD on livestock.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40789/29496,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Seroprevalence and associated risk factors of ovine neosporosis worldwide: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Neosporosis, caused by the protozoan Neospora caninum, has been widely reported and discussed as a major disease associated with reproductive problems in herds of various animal species. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence and risk factors associated with ovine neosporosis worldwide. This is the first systematic review, which was performed according to the established preferred reporting items in systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to address ovine neosporosis. Four databases were used in this study: PubMed, SciELO, Web of Science, and Scopus. The selected keywords were “neospora AND sheep,” “neosporosis AND sheep,” “neospora AND lamb,” “neosporosis AND lamb,” “neospora AND ewe,” and “neosporosis AND ewe.” The meta-analysis calculations were performed with random-effects models for proportions, and heterogeneity was tested using the I2 test. This study identified 24 studies on ovine neosporosis, nine of which evaluated the factors associated with the risk of seropositivity. After meta-analysis, the pooled estimated prevalence was 12% (95% CI, 8-16%; I² p-value < 0.01). The evaluation of the included studies allowed the identification of ovine neosporosis distribution in continents according to demonstrated prevalence rates. We confirmed via meta-analysis that the use of indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFAT) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of ovine neosporosis was not a source of data heterogeneity. The presence of dogs on the properties was reported as the main risk factor associated with the occurrence of ovine neosporosis; however, this was not confirmed by the meta-analysis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41187/29480,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Characterization of physiological maturity of Physalis peruviana L. fruits,"Physalis peruviana L. has great nutritional value and economic viability, representing an innovation for Brazilian horticulture. However, knowing the ideal point of harvesting fruits of this species is a key factor in this process that allows maximum post-harvest utilization, providing better quality and minimal losses when the fruit is harvested at physiological maturity. Therefore, this study was conducted to characterize the physiological maturity of Physalis peruviana L. fruits. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design in which the treatmentscorresponded to different stages of fruit and seed maturation (20, 27, 34, and 41 days after anthesis [DAA]), with four replicates. The analyzed variables consisted of colorimetry (lightness, chroma and hue angle) of calyx and fruit; fresh weight, diameter (transverse and longitudinal), firmness, pH, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total soluble solids:titratable acidity ratio, vitamin C and phenolic compounds of fruits; and carotenoids and chlorophyll (a and b) of calyx.

2021,42,Controlled deterioration test to evaluate the physiological potential of sweet corn seeds,"The evaluation of the physiological potential of sweet corn seeds is essential in a quality control program and the choice of vigor tests using an adequate analysis methodology is essential to obtain reliable results. In this sense, this study aimed to standardize the methodology of the controlled deterioration test through combinations between time and temperature to evaluate the vigor of sweet corn seeds. Six lots of sweet corn seeds were characterized by the degree of moisture and the initial physiological potential through the following tests: germination, first germination count, cold test, electrical conductivity, accelerated aging, length and dry mass of normal seedlings, seedling emergence in sand, and emergence rate index. Subsequently, these lots had their initial water content adjusted to 20% using the wet substrate method. The seeds from the six lots were subjected to the controlled deterioration test under two temperatures for four periods, obtaining a completely randomized design in an 8 × 6 factorial scheme with eight combinations of time/temperature and six lots. Germination and the first germination count were evaluated after the deterioration test. The data were subjected to analysis of variance with a comparison of means by the Tukey test at a 5% significance. The results of the first count and germination tests after deterioration were subjected to a simple linear correlation study together with the initial characterization data. The combinations 8 h – 40 °C and 8 h – 45 °C in the controlled deterioration test were efficient in distinguishing the vigor of seed lots. The shorter exposure period and the first germination count after deterioration are more suitable for evaluating the vigor of sweet corn seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40207/29184,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Potassium nitrate to overcome dormancy of Urochloa humidicola Comum seeds,"The main difficulty with propagating Urochloa humidicola Comum is the high percentage of seed dormancy. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a treatment to overcome seed dormancy and promote seed germination of this species that can be applied at a large scale. This study was conducted in two stages. First, the following treatments were evaluated using one seed lot: control (without treatment), immersion in H2SO4 (98%, 36N) for 10 min, moistening the germination substrate with KNO3 (0.2%) and immersion in KNO3 at concentrations of 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% for periods of 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, followed by drying in the shade. In the second stage, three seed lots were evaluated in all of the aforementioned treatments, except for those of immersion in 0% KNO3 and of all concentrations for 36 and 48 h. The seeds were evaluated for water content, germination, percentage of abnormal seedlings, dead and dormant seeds, first count, and average germination time. Immersion in the KNO3 solution was efficient in overcoming dormancy and promoting germination. To be used by companies, the immersion of seeds in a 4% KNO3 solution for 24 h was the most suitable treatment to overcome dormancy and promote the germination of U. humidicola Comum seeds.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40397/29152,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Agronomic performance of ‘BRS Princesa’ banana under fertigation and mulching,"Banana is one of the most produced fruit crops in Brazil and has great economic, social and nutritional importance. Factors such as water availability and well-managed fertilization are fundamental to achieving profitable yields. The aim of this study was to examine the agronomic performance and water use efficiency of ‘BRS Princesa’ banana under combinations of irrigation systems, fertilization methods and mulching, during three production cycles. The experiment was laid out in a randomized-block design with four replicates. Treatments consisted of a combination of the localized irrigation system, fertilization strategy and mulching, as follows: Drip irrigation with manual fertilization; Micro-sprinkler irrigation with manual fertilization; Drip fertigation with mulch; Drip fertigation without mulch; Micro-sprinkler fertigation with mulch; and Micro-sprinkler fertigation without mulch. The plants were irrigated every three days, using three 4-L h-1 drippers per plant or a 64-L h-1 micro-sprinkler for every four plants. The following variables were analyzed: number of leaves, plant height, pseudostem circumference, number of hands, hand yield, water and nutrient (nitrogen and potassium) use efficiency and earliness. The micro-sprinkler system provided a greater pseudostem circumference without the presence of mulch. Plants under micro-sprinkler fertigation with mulching grew taller. The banana yield was higher when fertigation was used than with manual fertilization, regardless of the irrigation system. Plants grown in mulched soil were more productive than those grown in bare soil. The use of mulch increased water, nitrogen and potassium use efficiency when compared with cultivation in bare soil. Drip-irrigated plants showed earlier production than those irrigated with micro-sprinklers.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40502/29153,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Cell damage, gas exchange, and growth of Annona squamosa L. under saline water irrigation and potassium fertilization","The semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil has water limitations in terms of both quantity and quality, with salt stress as a limiting factor for increasing yield in most crops. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate cell damage, gas exchange, and growth of custard apple under salt stress and potassium fertilization. The research was carried out at the Experimental Farm of CCTA/UFCG, in São Domingos-PB, Brazil. A randomized block design was arranged in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme, with two levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECw; 1.3 and 4.0 dS m-1) and five potassium doses (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 g of K2O per plant per year). Water salinity of 4.0 dS m-1 negatively affected the stem diameter and number of leaves in custard apple at 179 and 210 days after transplanting (DAT). The highest relative growth in stem diameter in the period of 179-245 DAT was obtained in plants irrigated with 4.0 dS m-1 water and fertilized with 20 g of K2O per plant. Potassium doses of up to 30 g of K2O resulted in a higher percentage of cell damage and relative water content in custard apple leaf tissue. Water saturation deficit decreased with the increase in K2O doses in plants irrigated with water of 1.3 dS m-1. Irrigation with 1.3 dS m-1 water and estimated K2O doses ranging from 16 to 22 g per plant resulted in an increase in stomatal conductance, transpiration, CO2 assimilation rate, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency in custard apple plants at 210 DAT.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40742/29154,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Post-harvest physiology of pitaya at different ripening stages,"Red fleshed pitaya is an attractive fruit not due only to the color of its flesh and skin, but also the scaly shape of its skin. In addition to being a source of vitamins and minerals, it has high commercial value and represents an alternative for cultivation in semiarid regions. Information about the post-harvest physiology of pitaya, which interferes with its ripening, allows the adoption of preservation and quality-maintenance practices. This study examines the respiratory activity and post harvest alterations of pitaya picked in the commercially immature stage of ripeness, by comparing them with fruits picked fully ripe. Physical and chemical aspects of the fruits were evaluated in two harvests, in 2019 and 2020. Six days after harvest, there was an increase in respiratory activity and a change in color in both ripe and commercially immature fruits. Therefore, pitayas picked commercially immature in both harvests had an increase in respiratory activity post-harvest, with a change in skin color during storage; and six days after harvest, in the 2019 harvest, the fruits resembled those that ripened on the plant, without having their quality compromised. However, in the 2020 harvest, six days after harvest, the fruits picked fully ripe showed soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio, betacyanins and ascorbic acid contents similar to those measured in the commercially immature fruits.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41264/29156,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Preconsolidation stress of gibbsitic and kaolinitic Oxisols under a multipractice conservationist coffee system,"Our goal was to analyze the impact of a multipractice soil conservationist system on coffee production in tropical soils (LATOSSOLO VERMELHO-AMARELO caulinítico/kaolinitic Haplustox and LATOSSOLO VERMELHO-gibbsítico/gibbsitic Acrustox soils) in Minas Gerais, Brazil. In the experimental area, the soil management involved a set of multiple conservationist practices during cultivation for more than 3.5 yrs. Soil samples were collected at 0-5, 10-15, and 20-25 cm depths at two positions: within planting rows and between rows. The soil physical and mechanical properties were determined, with a focus mainly on the preconsolidation stress model (preconsolidation stress versus matric tension). For the purpose of analysis, a split-split plot experimental design was implemented. A linear mixed regression (LMR) model was fitted, and Wald’s test was performed (P < 0.05). An improvement of soil physical quality for both Oxisols was observed at the planting row position. The effects of multipractice soil management after 3.5 yrs of cultivation in association with increased gibbsite content could promote new soil structure organization, as revealed by LMR, resulting in more resilient soils (between rows) and increasing the resistance to external pressures on gibbsitic Acrustox soils. Overall, the findings herein are in concordance with global trends towards conservationist practices that may alleviate soil compaction in agricultural systems to maintain environmental sustainability.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41338/29157,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,SO2-generating pads reduce gray mold in clamshell-packaged ‘Rubi’ table grapes grown under a two-cropping per year system,"The aim of this work was to evaluate different SO2-generating pads and liners to control gray mold in ventilated clamshell-packaged ‘Rubi’ table grapes grown under a two-cropping per year system. The treatments consisted of SO2-generating pads (slow release or dual release) and plastic liners with different perforations (microperforated; 2.0; 4.0 or 5.0 mm in diameter) and a control, only with the standard microperforated plastic liner. The packaged grapes were stored in a cold chamber at 1.0 ± 1.0 °C and 95% relative humidity. After 45 days, the grapes were removed from cold storage and placed, without liners and SO2-generating pads, for 3 days at room temperature (22.0 ± 1.0 °C). The evaluations occurred at 30 and 45 days after the beginning of cold storage, and the following variables were assessed: incidence of gray mold, mass loss, stem browning and shattered berries. At 3 days of shelf-life, the same variables were assessed, except mass loss. The completely randomized design was used as a statistical model with four replications, and each plot consisted of five bunches individually stored in ventilated clamshell-packaged. The dual release SO2-generating pads are efficient in controlling the gray mold in ‘Rubi’ table grapes regardless of the type of perforation of the plastic liners, with low mass loss and shattered berries, with good conservation of the freshness of the rachis. The disease was efficiently controlled in both annual crops. The slow-release SO2-generating pads, regardless of the type of perforation of the plastic liners, resulted in intermediate efficiency of gray mold control, with good physical quality of the bunches. Thus, the use of dual release SO2-generating pads is recommended to control gray mold in ventilated clamshell-packaged ‘Rubi’ table grapes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41365/29185,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Sodium content in meat products: suitability to labeling and the voluntary agreements,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the sodium concentration in meat products, to ascertain their appropriateness for labels and agreements set up between the Health Ministry and the Brazilian Association of Food Industries. A total of 96 meat derivative samples (italian salami, chicken pate, cooked ham, ham, sausage, bologna, tuscan sausage and smoked mixed sausage) were collected from different brands and batches. Using flame emission spectroscopy, the samples were analyzed for sodium levels based on the official methodology. It was observed that 46.9% of the companies showed values in nutritional labeling to be noncompliant with the Brazilian legislation. In fact, 31.2% of the brands assessed failed to satisfy the sodium reduction target decided upon for 2017. The italian salami was the product with the higher sodium content present a average value among the brands of 1716.11 mg 100 g-1. It became evident that merely implementing voluntary agreements had failed to provide total adequacy in the sodium content of the meat products. There is also great need for the industries to be more engaged in finding substitutes to minimize the sodium levels in the foods, without inducing significant alterations in the physicochemical, microbiological and technological features of the products, apart from the higher inspection by the government agencies in terms of agreement compliance and population awareness.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41692/29159,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Salinomycin intoxication in pigs associated with the use of tiamulin in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil","This paper describes a spontaneous outbreak of toxic myopathy in finishing pigs due to the ingestion of feed with salinomycin associated with tiamulin and addresses the control methods performed during the outbreak to minimize economic losses resulting from the intoxication. A lot of 940 pigs fed feed containing 30 ppm salinomycin received 100 ppm tiamulin (via water) to control recurrent respiratory diseases on the farm. After ingesting tiamulin, some animals manifested clinical signs of motor incoordination, stiff gait, reluctance to move, muscle weakness and tremors, dyspnea, depression, and decubitus, remaining in “sitting-dog position” or with the abduction of the pelvic limbs, and rested on tip-toes when in a standing position. Two animals were euthanized for macro-and microscopic evaluation. The other sick animals received supportive anti-inflammatory treatment. The most relevant macroscopic finding observed during necropsy was the slight pallor of the pelvic limb muscles. The main histopathological findings consisted of multifocal areas of hyaline degeneration and marked necrosis of skeletal myofibers, with macrophage infiltrate associated with cell regeneration and skeletal fiber phagocytosis. These lesions were more intense in the longissimus dorsi, diaphragm, and masseter muscles. The definitive diagnosis was based on epidemiological aspects and clinical lesional conditions compatible with toxic myopathy secondary to ionophore intoxication.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38248/29189,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Sheep urinary tract architecture is not affected by acute urethral obstruction,"Urolithiasis affects the urinary tract of small ruminants, thereby requiring the animal to prematurely terminate breeding. Morphometric study of organs can be used as a diagnostic method. Thus, this study aimed to describe the macroscopic, histopathological, and histomorphometric changes in the urinary tract of sheep with urolithiasis. For this purpose, 14 healthy male Santa Inês sheep, approximately 90 days old, were studied and fed an experimental diet. After the development of urolithiasis, the animals were reorganized into two groups, D1 (without urolithiasis) and D2 (with urolithiasis) for comparative data analysis. Sheep were necropsied to evaluate the pathological changes, followed by macroscopic morphometric analysis, and the histopathological and histomorphometric characteristics were described. Urethral necrosis and a full urinary bladder were observed in all animals that developed the disease. The comparison between sheep with and without urolithiasis showed no significant difference (P < 0.05) in the evaluated macroscopic morphometric variables, except for the right ureter width. Regarding the histopathological evaluation, multifocal areas of mild to moderate congestion within the glomerular tufts and protein in the tubular lumen of the kidneys were observed. In the liver, mild to moderate fatty degeneration was noted in the centrolobular regions, and an ulcerated focal area in the bladder mucosa was observed in only one animal. The present study demonstrated that the formulated diet was effective in inducing clinical disease. In acute obstructive urolithiasis in sheep tissue, lesions in the liver and urinary tract were observed, although there were no significant histomorphometric changes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38390/29161,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Main causes of chicken carcass condemnations in Espírito Santo, Brazil","Brazil is the third largest producer and the main exporter of chicken meat in the world. In 2019, it produced approximately 13.245 million tons of the product, generating more than six million dollars. According to the Poultry Association of the state of Espírito Santo, broiler production is carried out by 28 independent producers/companies, three integrator businesses, 42 integrated producers and seven slaughterhouses (structures with SIF, SIE/SISBI or SIE certification). Despite the growth of this sector, problems persist regarding the quality of carcasses and the number of condemnations. From the sanitary and industrial point of view, all products of animal origin must undergo prior inspection. The present study was developed using data generated by the Federal Inspection Service (Serviço de Inspeção Federal, SIF) and the State Inspection Service (Serviço de Inspeção Estadual, SIE). The main causes of condemnation of birds as inspected by SIF represented 9.26% of the slaughtered birds. Total condemnations corresponded to 1.35%. Overall, this study recorded a greater number of condemnations of non-pathological origin. In conclusion, there was consistency in the reasons why these products were condemned. Bruises/fractures and contamination were the most frequent causes according to both inspection services (SIF and SIE), indicating a common problem on the slaughter and inspection lines.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40728/29163,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Synchronization with estradiol benzoate in the presence of the corpus luteum in Wagyu cows increases the number of medium follicles but does not interfere with in vitro production of embryos,"Reproductive biotechnologies emerge as an important element for livestock, however, some strategies must be modified to adapt the different breeding systems, such as the use of follicular synchronization protocols. This study aimed to evaluate follicular synchronization using estradiol benzoate, with the presence of the corpus luteum, on the in vitro embryo production (IVEP) from Wagyu oocytes donors. Routines of IVEP were performed in heifers and cows (n=19), classified into three groups: G1/CL- animals with corpus luteum; G2/SCL- animals without corpus luteum, these groups being the control, and had the natural process of follicular dynamics and G3/CL + EB - animals with the presence of corpus luteum, submitted to follicular synchronization at D0, with estradiol benzoate. The results obtained showed that the synchronization of the follicular wave with the application of EB, in the presence of the corpus luteum (CL), reduced the number of small (6.05 ± 0.55) and large follicles (0.45 ± 0.15), but increased (P<0.05) the amount of medium follicles (16.20 ± 0.90). However, the results of OPU showed that the number of viable oocytes and the viability rate, depending on the application or not of EB and the presence or not of CL in Wagyu donor, did not differ between groups (P>0.05).  It was concluded that follicular synchronization using estradiol benzoate in Wagyu oocyte donors, presenting a corpus luteum, increased the number of medium follicles, however, there was no improvement in the efficiency of ovum pick-up, in vitro embryo production and pregnancy rate.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40918/29164,E-ISSN 1679-0359

After slaughter, the carcass yield, fat thickness, loin eye area, the depth and perimeter of the loin eye, and the pH and temperature at 45 min and 24 h post-mortem, along with the drip loss and color of the Longissimus lumborum were evaluated. The economic viability of the diets was calculated. The inclusion of DDGS showed a quadratic effect on daily feed intake over 0-14 days. Pigs fed with 300 g kg -1 of DDGS showed worse feed conversion than those fed the control diet over 0-7, 0-14 and 0-21 days. The a* color parameter of the meat decreased linearly with increasing DDGS concentration but the other carcass and meat characteristics were not affected. Inclusion of 184.1 g kg -1 of DDGS showed the best economic viability, considering the cost of weight gain. DDGS may be included in pig diets up to 200 g kg -1 without affecting the performance or carcass and meat characteristics, while 300 g kg -1 compromises feed conversion.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39745/29165,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Meat quality of cattle subjected to period of aging process: a cross-heifer study,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of aging on meat quality of crossbred heifers. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of carcasses and meat of 148 crossbred heifers with an average age of 13 months and 407.5 ± 29.22 kg body weight at slaughter were performed. After cooling for 24 h, the carcasses were evaluated for hot carcass weight, pH, conformation, physiological maturity, finishing, fat distribution, and length. Characteristics, such as pH, color, marbling, exudation, as well as cooking losses, percentage of ether extract, and shear force were evaluated in meat at time zero and after seven days of aging. The carcasses displayed satisfactory results for parameters such as pH at 24 h of cooling (pH24), finishing, distribution of fat, and subcutaneous fat thickness (5.58, 3.27, 2.40, and 6.62 mm, respectively). The meat had a low marbling score (5.08) and percentage of ether extract (1.71), indicating that the meat was relatively lean. Exudation and cooking losses showed similar results at zero and seven days of aging. The meat subjected to seven days of aging showed higher lightness and hue (40.98 and 0.77, respectively) and tenderness of 5.25 kg. These results indicated that aging affected meat color and shear force parameters; the meat of cross-heifers was softer but less red after maturation.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39753/29166,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effect of particle size on storage time of hydrated corn grain,"Dry ground corn kernels are widely used as sources of energy readily available for microbial synthesis in the rumen. The objective of the present study was to measure the effect of particle size on the storage length of rehydrated and ensiled corn grain. Commercial corn was milled in 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-mm sieves, rehydrated until reaching 65% DM, and ensiled for 14, 28, and 56 days, in a completely randomized design with a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement, with six replications per treatment. PVC mini-silos were used, with dimensions of 25 cm height x 10 cm of diameter. The variables DM, MM, CP, NDF, ADF, pH, molds and yeasts count, fermentative losses, in vitro degradability and aerobic stability were subjected to analysis of variance. The Tukey test was used to compare means. LAB counts was subjected to Wilcoxon's non-parametric test, considering significance at p < 0.05. Rehydrated corn silages with smaller particles (2 and 4 mm) showed higher LAB and mold counts, higher levels of CP and EE and higher density at opening silos than that of coarser particles. However, they showed lower percentages of DM, and were susceptible to microbial attack and faster temperature increases than were coarse particles during the chosen storage times. Silage subjected to 56 days of fermentation showed lower contents of NDF, ADF and CP, lower gas losses and lower pH values in aerobiosis, and increased levels of soluble protein (A + B1 fractions), losses by effluents, number of hours to reach maximum temperature, and time to break aerobic stability. Coarse-grind silages subjected to 56 days of storage showed better chemical composition, lower LAB and mold counts, and less susceptibility to microbial degradation when exposed to air.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39958/29192,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Acerola seed meal (Malpighia emarginata) as a source of dietary fibre in starter piglet diets,"Three experiments were carried out to determine the nutritional value and the effect of acerola seed meal (ASM) for starter piglet diets on feed digestibility, nitrogen balance (NB), growth performance and blood metabolites. Twenty-four crossbred entire male piglets (21.07 ± 3.07 kg) were assigned to a digestibility assay (Exp. I) and distributed in a randomised block design (RBD) with two treatments composed of reference diet (RD) or test diet (20% replacement with ASM), 12 replications and with one pig per experimental unit (EU). An NB study (Exp. II) was conducted with four levels of ASM (0, 4, 8 and 12%) and 24 crossbred entire male piglets (20.78 ± 1.84 kg) allocated in an RBD of six replications and one pig per EU. The growth performance study (Exp. III) involved 120 crossbred piglets: 60 entire males and 60 females (13.85 ± 1.49 kg). Treatments consisted of a gender combination and five levels of ASM (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12%), distributed in an RBD with six replications and four animals per EU. The physicochemical composition results indicated 86.12% of dry matter (DM), 8.03% of crude protein (CP) and 4,553 kcal kg-1 of gross energy (GE) as well as apparent digestibility coefficients of 39.04 and 28.21% for CP and GE, respectively. The levels of ASM that provided the maximum estimate for final body weight, daily body weight gain and average daily feed intake were 2.93% (p = 0.037), 3.05% (p = 0.040) and 4.27% (p = 0.043), respectively. ASM can be indicated as a dietary fibre source for starter piglet diets because it contains relevant nutritional and energy values, without affecting the nitrogen balance and blood urea concentration.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40039/29168,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Carnauba wax coating preserves the internal quality of commercial eggs during storage,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the internal quality and lipid oxidation of eggs coated with a carnauba wax-based product at different concentrations and stored for up to 28 days under two temperatures. For analysis of internal quality, the eggs were assigned to a completely randomized 3 x 4 factorial design (uncoated eggs (control); eggs coated with carnauba wax at 12% concentration (Aruá®); eggs coated with carnauba wax at 15% concentration (Aruá®); four storage periods - 7, 14, 21, and 28 days). Fifteen eggs from each treatment were evaluated in each storage period, with each egg representing one replicate, i.e., 300 eggs per storage temperature (10 and 25°C). Egg weight loss, yolk percent (%), albumen percent (%), Haugh unit, yolk index, and specific gravity were calculated. Lipid oxidation of the egg yolk was measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), using 10 eggs at time 0 (fresh) and 30 eggs in each storage period (7, 14, 21, and 28 days), in triplicate, under only one storage temperature (25°C). A total of five pools, consisting of two eggs each, were used for each treatment. Each pool was considered a replicate, and each treatment consisted of five replicates. The weight loss of the eggs stored at 10°C and 25°C during the storage period was, on average, 46.1% and 37.3% lower for the eggs coated with carnauba wax than in uncoated eggs, respectively. Overall, coated eggs, regardless the concentration of the wax (12 or 15%) had higher Haugh units, specific gravity, and yolk index than uncoated eggs, in both temperatures (10 and 25°C). Uncoated and coated eggs showed similar lipid oxidation values regardless of the storage period. On the other hand, eggs coated with solutions containing 15% wax showed less oxidation than eggs coated with 12% wax. The coating of commercial eggs with carnauba wax, both at concentrations of 12 and 15%, was effective in maintaining their internal quality during storage at both storage temperatures (10 and 25°C). Eggs stored at 25°C had lower quality traits during storage compared with eggs kept under refrigeration. Coating eggs with wax did not minimize the oxidative processes in the egg yolk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40315/29257,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Behavioral, productive, reproductive and thermoregulatory performance of lactating 3/4 and 7/8 Holstein/Gir cows","The aim of this study was to examine the behavioral, productive, reproductive and thermoregulatory performance of 3/4 and 7/8 Holstein/Gir (HG) dairy cows to identify which genetic composition suffers the least heat stress. A completely randomized design was adopted involving 20 multiparous, lactating crossbred cows from a dairy farm located in the municipality of Turvânia - GO, Brazil. During the experimental period, data on behavioral, productive, reproductive and thermoregulatory traits were collected every 15 days. Bioestat (5.0) statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The mean temperature-humidity index, ambient temperature and relative humidity obtained throughout the experimental period were 74.45, 30.51 ºC and 63.64%, respectively. In terms of reproductive performance, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the genetic compositions for the time from calving to first service, with a longer period shown by the animals with greater Holstein breed genetic composition. Service period and calving interval differed significantly (p < 0.05) during the experimental period between the genetic compositions. A significant difference (p < 0.05) was also detected between the compositions for respiratory rate, with higher values observed in the animals with higher European genetic composition. Benezra thermal comfort index also differed significantly (p < 0.05), with the 7/8 HG animals showing a higher value. Lactating cows with a 7/8 HG genetic composition achieved better results in milk production, whereas those with 3/4 HG genetic composition showed superiority in milk fat composition and reproductive and thermoregulatory performance, indicating greater adaptation to the climatic conditions of the region.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40378/29170,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Metabolic status of crossbred Charolais × Nellore cows throughout the final third of gestation and lactation,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the metabolic status of beef cows during the final third of gestation and thereafter until the end of the subsequent breeding season. The study was conducted using 30 beef cows, aged between 4 and 11 years, derived from crosses between Charolais and Nellore cattle. To assess the metabolic status of cows, we obtained measurements of body weight and condition (BW and BCS), and complemented these by analyzing the following blood metabolites: total proteins, globulins, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Assessments were performed at 95 days pre-calving, and again at 7, 21, 63, and 110 days post-calving. The experimental design was completely randomized with five collection periods and 30 repetitions (cows). The BW of cows was found to be highest at 110 days postpartum (489.1 kg), and loss of BW was observed between 21 and 63 days postpartum (-3.72 kg). The lowest BCS value was recorded after 63 days of lactation (2.85 points). With respect to blood metabolites, concentrations of total proteins were higher at 7 and 110 days postpartum relative to the levels recorded during gestation (8.3 and 8.3 vs. 7.7 g dL-1, respectively), whereas serum globulin levels were higher at 7, 21, and 110 days postpartum relative to those at gestation (5.2, 5.2, and 5.1 vs. 4.8 g dL -1, respectively). Compared with samples obtained during gestation, the highest levels of albumin (P < 0.05) were observed at 7, 63, and 110 days postpartum (3.1, 3.1, and 3.2 vs. 2.9 g dL-1, respectively). Serum glucose was higher during pregnancy and in the first week of lactation relative to the values recorded after 21 and 63 days of lactation (80.9 and 76.7 vs 71.5 and 72.3 mg dL-1, respectively). Moreover, cholesterol concentrations increased with the progression of lactation, with the highest value being recorded at 110 days postpartum (222.1 mg dL-1). Collectively, the findings of this study, indicate that Charolais × Nellore cows raised exclusively on native pasture mobilize body reserves, lose weight, and show a negative energy balance during the first weeks of lactation, with detrimental consequences for subsequent reproductive activity.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40770/29171,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Effect of inoculants in corn silage on dry matter digestibility, ingestive behavior, performance and carcass of heifers","We aim to evaluate inoculants with different strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in corn silage on ingestive behavior, apparent digestibility of diet, performance and carcass traits of heifers. The treatments were: corn silage without inoculant (control); with 11CFT inoculant (strains of Lactobacillus buchneri and Lactobacillus casei) and with 11C33 inoculant (Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum and Enterococcus faecium) with six repetitions each. Ingestive behavior, weight gain and daily dry matter intake was not affected by the use of inoculants in corn silage. The apparent digestibility of diet was higher to silage with 11C33 inoculant, not differing from the diet with silage with 11CFT (73.30% and 71.99%, respectively). The animals fed silage inoculated with 11CFT obtained greater values of carcass gain and average daily carcass gain (86.33 kg and 0.833 kg day-1, respectively).

2021,42,Use of near-infrared spectroscopy for prediction of chemical composition of Tifton 85 grass,"The reduction in the quality, consumption, and digestibility of forage can cause a decrease in animal performance, resulting in losses to the rural producer. Thus, it is important to monitor these characteristics in forage plants to devise strategies or practices that optimize production systems. The aim of this study was to develop and validate prediction models using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the chemical composition of Tifton 85 grass. Samples of green grass, its morphological structures (whole plant, leaf blade, stem + sheath, and senescent material) and hay, totaling 105 samples were used. Conventional chemical analysis was performed to determine the content of oven-dried samples (ODS), mineral matter (MM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), cellulose (CEL), hemicellulose (HEM), and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD). Subsequently, all the samples were scanned using a Vis-NIR spectrometer to collect spectral data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data set, and modified partial least squares was used to correlate reference values to spectral data. The coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.74, 0.85, 0.98, 0.75, 0.85, 0.71, 0.82, 0.77, and 0.93, and the ratio of performance deviations (RPD) obtained were 1.99, 2.71, 6.46, 2.05, 2.58, 3.84, 1.86, 2.35, 2.09, and 3.84 for ODS, MM, CP, NDF, ADF, ADL, CEL, HEM, and IVDMD, respectively. The prediction models obtained, in general, were considered to be of excellent quality, and demonstrated that the determination of the chemical composition of Tifton 85 grass can be performed using NIRS technology, replacing conventional analysis.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40793/29173,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Comparison of random regression models, traditional animal model and with the inclusion of molecular markers in the estimation of genetic parameters in Colombian Holstein cattle","The use of molecular markers to identify desirable genes in animal production is known as marker-assisted selection. The traditional genetic evaluation model uses the BLUP methodology; when genetic markers are included in the evaluation model, the methodology is known as M-BLUP. In contrast, random regression models (RRM), unlike the models based on production at 305 days, consider factors that change for each animal from one test to another. The objective of this study was to compare variance components, genetic parameters and breeding values for milk production, protein percentage and somatic cell score in Colombian Holstein cattle using BLUP, M-BLUP and RRM. For the estimation of genetic parameters and values, 2003 lactations corresponding to 1417 cows in 55 herds were used, and effects of the order of delivery, herd, and contemporary group were included. The three traits presented greater heritability under the MBLUP model: 0.44 for protein percentage, 0.27 for milk production and 0.28 for somatic cell score. This was because the genetic variance was greater when M-BLUP was used, which allowed a greater accuracy of the breeding value estimation in the three traits. Therefore, the model that includes information on molecular markers is more suitable for genetic evaluation in Colombian Holstein cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41064/29174,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Obtaining microsatellite markers for Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum using heterologous primers,"Studies on genetic composition in fish populations contribute to conservationist practices and inbreeding control in fish stocks. To this end, molecular tools such as microsatellite markers (SSRs) are often used, but they are expensive and time-consuming to develop. A species-specific heterologous marker emerges as an alternative, which can be used in taxonomically related species in a fast way. Our goal was to test SSRs markers of Brachyplatystoma rousseauxi and Pseudoplatystoma punctifer in P. reticulatum in an unprecedented way. For this purpose, DNA was extracted from fragments of the caudal fin of 222 P. reticulatum adults, using a NaCl-based method. Then, DNA samples were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using six markers, four from B. rousseauxi (BR38, 47, 51, and 61) and two from P. punctifer (PPU13 and PPU15). Two primers showed non-specific amplification and were disregarded (BR38 and PPU13). In the remaining four primers, the number of alleles per locus varied between two (BR47) to sixteen (BR51), and the average size of alleles was between 142 and 400 bp. Mean effective number of alleles per locus ranged from 10,650 (BR51) to 1,784 (BR47), with null or low-frequency alleles in all studied loci. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.299 (BR47) to 0.640 (BR51) and was always lower than the expected heterozygosity. Hardy-Weinberg balance was significant (p < 0.05) in all loci, and inbreeding coefficient (FIS) was always positive. Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) confirmed the efficiency of the markers since they had moderate (BR47) to high levels of information (BR51, BR61, and PPU15). Transferability test showed that the heterologous microsatellite molecular markers, originally for B. rousseauxi and P. punctifer, were efficient in P. reticulatum, producing three primers with high information content. Therefore, these markers can be safely used in future population studies of this species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41215/29175,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Standardization of blood meal production process at a rendering plant using design of experiments,"This research focuses on the standardization of the blood meal production process at a Colombian rendering plant through a design of experiments. Initially, 108 samples of blood meal were taken where only 23% achieved the moisture target (7.5% to 8.5%). Therefore, an analysis of the measurement system was performed using a repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) study. Results showed that 39.96% of the observed variability was caused by the measurement system that was out of control. So, it was necessary to improve the method of sampling reducing the participation of the measurement system in the variability of the process to only 3.79%. Later, several experiments were accomplished with a 2k factorial design. Each experiment consisted of a response variable (blood meal moisture), two controllable factors (drying chamber temperature and percentage of rotation of the metering screw), and an uncontrollable factor (initial blood meal moisture). Finally, experiments were carried out and validated observing that, with a drying chamber temperature of 160 °C and a percentage of screw rotation of 29%, more than 97% of the blood meal was according to the moisture target. In conclusion, is confirmed that the design of experiments is a tool that allows a clear path towards optimization and standardization of processes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42081/29191,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Methodology of the tetrazolium test for identifying viable seeds of orchids of the genus Cattleya native to the Brazilian Cerrado,"Orchids need measures for conservation of their species, among them the creation of seed banks. This study analyzes suitable methodologies to identify the viability of Cattleya seeds through the tetrazolium test. Seeds of Cattleya nobilior Rchb. and Cattleya walkeriana Gardn. were submitted to three preconditioning: no soaking (control); sucrose (10%); or distilled water. After 24 hours, they were submitted to tetrazolium solution with three types of conditioning: oven (40 °C); water bath (40 °C); or room temperature. Subsequently, the percentage of viable seeds (VS) was calculated and in vitro sowing was carried out. Germination percentage (G) was determined after 45 days. A completely randomized design was used for each species studied, with treatments arranged in a 3x3 factorial scheme (three preconditioning and three conditioning), with eight replicates of one tube each. The experiment was performed in duplicate. The highest viability values found in the tetrazolium test were close to those of germination (C. nobilior: VS = 88% e G = 97%; C. walkeriana: VS = 88% e G = 95%) for Cattleya species native to the Cerrado. The conditioning at ambient temperature had a greater effect on seed visualization for both species studied, suggesting that the tetrazolium test should be performed at this conditioning temperature.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40227/29177,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Biomass productivity of Chlorella vulgaris cultivated in fish and dairy cattle wastewaters,"The biomass productivity and nutrient composition of microalgae, such as Chlorella vulgaris, depend on the cultivation process and the nutrient content of growth media. Thus, in this study aimed to investigate the biomass productivity of C. vulgaris cultivated in fish and dairy cattle wastewaters. Thirty wastewater samples (2.5 L) were collected from system of production. Microalgae were cultivated in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 mL of microalgae and 1,790 mL of wastewater under constant light of 5,000 lux for 16 days at 25 ± 2.0 °C. Wastewater samples differed in composition. Biomass productivity was 47 % higher (P<0.0001) in dairy cattle than in fish wastewater, reaching 67.61 g m?3 day?1 (dry matter basis, DM) when compared by Student’s t-test (P<0.05). Cultivation media also had an effect on biomass chemical composition. The C. vulgaris grown in dairy cattle wastewater was higher in crude protein and ash contents (359.6 g kg?1 DM and 230.4 g kg?1 DM, respectively), whereas microalgae grown in fish wastewater had higher nitrogen-free extract content (347.8 g kg?1 DM). Crude fat content did not vary greatly (mean of 313.15 g kg?1 DM). The pH (8.0 – 8.7) and ammonia concentration (0.07 to 0.4 mg L?1) in fish wastewater was stable throughout the 16-day experimental period. In dairy wastewater, pH increased up (6.3 to 8.9) to the fourth day and remained constant thereafter, and ammonia concentration increased up (24.3 to 28.7 mg L?1) to the eighth day and then it declined (2.1 mg L?1). The C. vulgaris was successfully grown in both wastewaters, but productivity was higher in dairy cattle wastewater.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39296/29179,E-ISSN 1679-0359

A total of 650 one-day-old female Japanese quails were distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments according to the dietary levels of bee pollen (0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6%), five replicates, and 26 birds per experimental unit. At the end of the experimental period (35 days of age), the performance and relative weight of the gastrointestinal organs and length of small and large intestines were evaluated. The dietary inclusion of bee pollen did not influence (P > 0.05) performance, relative weight of proventriculus, gizzard, pancreas, liver, and large intestine, as well as the length of small and large intestines. However, a linear reduction (P < 0.05) was observed in the relative weight of small intestine as dietary bee pollen levels increased.

2021,42,Correlation between vigor by accelerated aging at pre-sowing and soybean seedling emergence in the field,"Although the accelerated aging test is widely used to determine seed vigor, there are methodological variations in seed exposure time at 41 °C. Therefore, the objective was to indicate the most appropriate seed exposure time to segregate lots that also exhibits a correlation with seedling emergence in the field, and establish vigor levels using the aforementioned test. Soybean seed samples were collected at pre-sowing, representing 100 lots in the 2016/2017 growing season and 125 lots in the 2017/2018 season from different warehouses in 4 regions of Santa Catarina state (SC). Physiological quality was evaluated by germination, accelerated aging (24 and 48 h at 41 °C) and field emergence tests. The results were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis and Pearson’s correlation analysis (p < 0.05). The rank sum index, associated with the Scott-Knott clustering method, was used to classify physiological quality. The average germination percentage was 90 and 91% in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 growing seasons, respectively. Vigor obtained an average of 86 (2016/2017) and 85% (2017/2018), when seeds were submitted to accelerated aging for 48 h, and 89% (both seasons) for 24 h. In regard to field emergence, the average was 85 and 80% in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 growing seasons, respectively. Considering the 225 lots, the greatest correlation with field emergence was observed in vigor - 48 h (r = 0.71 p < 0.05). Rank sum classification made it possible to establish vigor-based categories, whereby batches with over 85% vigor by 48-h accelerated aging were classified as high vigor, 70 to 84% medium vigor, and under 70% low vigor.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37771/29009,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Fruit production and quality of mini-watermelon with different number of stems, in troughs cultivation system and substrate reuse","Substrate-filled pots are growing systems commonly used for vegetable farming. However, few are the studies available relating them to mini-watermelon cultivation. Our study presents a growing system using substrate-filled troughs and leachate recirculation as a low-cost and less environmentally harmful soilless cultivation system for mini-watermelons. For a growing system to be viable and provide high fruit yield and quality, several aspects must be studied, including substrate physical properties and reuse potential in successive crops, besides plant management-related aspects. Therefore, our goal was to evaluate the effects of a trough system and substrate reuse on changes in the properties of raw rice husk and on fruit yield and quality for mini-watermelons at different stem training. To this purpose, two trials were conducted using nutrient solution recirculation systems. In the first, we evaluated the effects of pot and trough systems. In the second, first- and second-use substrates were compared in the trough system. In both trials, one and two-stem training systems were analyzed. The results of the first trial show that the trough system had a greater positive impact on substrate water holding capacity (WHC), which increased from 7.9 to 15.6%, while the pots increased substrate WHC only to 11.2%. However, both systems neither affected fruit yield (8 kg/m² on average) nor fruit quality. The two-stem training promoted higher fruit yields (4.2 kg/plant) and contents of total soluble solids - TSS (11.4 °Brix) but did not affect average fruit weight. Moreover, the one-stem training provided higher fruit number (7.3 fruits/m²) and fruit yield (9.7 kg/m²). In the second trial, the reused substrate showed a higher WHC (12.4%) than the one used for the first time (9.9%). The reused substrate also provided better results in terms of fruit yield and quality (5.9 fruits/m², 5.3 kg/m², and 10.5o Brix). In the second trial, two-stem training also increased average fruit weight, and hence yields per plant. Nevertheless, the stem number did not affect fruit number per plant, fruit yield per square meter, and fruit quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38059/29024,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Zinc application improves growth, yield and grain zinc concentration of mung bean (Vigna radiata L.)","Minerals’ deficiency, including iodine (I), vitamin A, iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) is a widespread threat to mankind. Around 2 billion people (children, women, and people of middle age group) across the globe suffer from mineral deficiencies. The productivity of mung bean is very low in arid and semi-arid regions due to little or no application of fertilizers. Majority of mung bean growing regions of Pakistan have low Zn concentration in soils. This study evaluated the impact of different Zn sources and their application methods on allometry, yield and grain biofortification of mung bean. Mung bean variety “Azri 2006” was used as experimental material. Three different Zn sources, i.e., zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), Zn-EDDHA and 50 % ZnSO4 + 50% Zn EDDHA. Application method included in the study was basal application, foliar application and 50% basal + 50% foliar application. The results indicated that Zn application improved allometric traits and productivity of mungbean. The ZnSO4 source of Zn with basal application resulted in the highest chlorophyll contents, leaf area index, number of sympodial and monopodial branches, and number of pods per plant, 1000-seeds weight, biological yield and seed yield as compared to control treatment. In conclusion, 10 kg ha-1 Zn application as basal application method seemed a viable option to improve mung bean productivity along with higher grain Zn biofortification.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39303/29023,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Optimal plot size in buckwheat,"The aim of this work was to compare three methods of estimating the optimal plot size for evaluating fresh matter in the IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench). Sixteen uniformity trials (blank experiments) were conducted, eight with the IPR91-Baili cultivar and eight with the IPR92-Altar cultivar. The trials were carried out at eight different sowing times. The fresh matter was evaluated in 576 basic experimental units (BEU), each 1 m × 1 m in size (36 BEU per trial). The optimal plot size was determined using the method of modified maximum curvature, the linear response plateau model and the quadratic response plateau model. The optimal plot size differs between methods, and decreases in the following order: quadratic response plateau model, linear response plateau model and modified maximum curvature. The optimal plot size for evaluating fresh matter in the IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars of buckwheat is 7.60 m2. This size can be used as a reference for future experiments with buckwheat.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39448/29330,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Genetic parameters and selection of micromineral-biofortified Andean bean lines with high technological quality,"The development of new micromineral-biofortified Andean bean cultivars with a grain pattern that meets consumers’ requirements is unprecedented. This study proposes to obtain estimates of phenotypic parameters for technological-quality traits and micromineral concentration and to select superior Andean bean lines. The cross between cultivars Hooter and Cal 96 generated the recombinant inbred line population that was evaluated in the F5:6 and F5:7 generations. Technological quality was analyzed based on grain color determined in a colorimeter: L* (dark to light), a* (green to red) and b* (blue to yellow) values; and mass of 100 grains. Micromineral concentration (iron and zinc) was obtained by acid digestion. A significant genotype effect was found for all evaluated traits, except for zinc concentration in the F5:7 generation. L*, a* and b* showed high heritability (h2 ? 90.85%) and qualitative inheritance. High heritability (h2 ? 75.57%) was also observed for mass of 100 grains and iron and zinc concentrations, which exhibited quantitative inheritance. Grains of the cranberry bean lines DFA 39-18 and DFA 01-18 are very light (L* ? 52.18), with light red (a* ? 9.49) and light yellow (b* ? 16.00) shades; large (mass of 100 grains > 40 g); and have high iron concentrations (Fe ? 95.00 mg kg-1 dry matter). Grains of the red mottled bean lines DFA 03-18, DFA 27-18 and DFA 44-18 exhibited high technological quality, i.e., are dark (33.11 < L* < 37.28), light red (16.24 < a*< 18.72) and very light yellow (b* ? 9.45) shades, and large (mass of 100 grains > 40 g).

In this context, we evaluated the flows of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3) in the surface waters of two micro-watersheds with different anthropic impacts. Water samples were collected from two micro-watersheds with different land uses (regenerated savanna and an agricultural site) from January 2014 to April 2015. In the rainy season, the samples were collected every 15 days, while in the dry season, samples were collected every 30 days. An automatic sampler in the stream collected the composed samples. Water flow was monitored with a sensor that measured the hydraulic load on the sill of the triangular spillway installed in each micro-watershed. The DOC and NO3 contents were analyze via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The flow was estimated based on the DOC and NO3 flows and concentrations. The DOC concentrations were higher in the Cerrado micro-watershed; however, there was no difference in NO3 concentrations. In both watersheds, there was a significant increase in the concentrations of DOC and NO3 on rainy days, with was more pronounced in the agricultural watershed.

2021,42,Nutrient content and accumulation in sugarcane under mineral fertilization and high doses of vinasse,"Vinasse, a waste from ethanol production, has been widely used as a means of fertigation in sugarcane. However, high dose limits application at and its effects on nutrient absorption and accumulation by the crop are not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare, during the initial development of sugarcane, the effect of mineral fertilization and high doses of vinasse on the macronutrient and sodium contents of the top visible dewlap (TVD) leaf and their respective accumulations in the aerial part of the crop. The experiment was carried out in 100-dm3 pots filled with Argisol. The treatments consisted of five doses of vinasse (0, 150, 300, 600 and 1200 m3 ha-1) and an additional treatment with no vinasse and mineral fertilizer (500 kg ha-1 of the NPK 14-24-18 formulation). The levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium were evaluated in the TVD leaf at 120 days after planting and their accumulation in the aerial part of the plant at 210 days. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and compared using regression analysis and orthogonal contrasts. The vinasse doses applied did not adequately nourish the crop in macronutrients. Mineral fertilization provided higher N and P levels. The highest doses of vinasse provided higher levels of K, Ca and Mg and larger accumulations of N, P, K and Na, but were detrimental to the accumulation of Ca. The descending order of accumulation of macronutrients and sodium with mineral fertilization was P> Ca> N> K> Mg> Na. For the application of vinasse, the descending order was K> P> Ca> N> Na> Mg. In the absence of mineral fertilization and vinasse, the descending order was P> Ca> K> N> Mg> Na.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40561/29017,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The experiment was carried out from March 2019 to January 2020 in a protected environment belonging to the Academic Unit of Agricultural Engineering of the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Campina Grande, PB, Brazil. The treatments consisted of eight combinations of irrigation water with different cationic natures: S1 - Control; S2 - Na+; S3 - Ca2+; S4 - Mg2+; S5 - Na+ + Ca2+; S6 - Na+ + Mg2+; S7 - Ca2+ + Mg2+, and S8 - Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+. Plants in the control treatment (S1) were irrigated using water with an electrical conductivity (ECw) of 0.4 dS m-1, while the other treatments (S2; S3; S4; S5; S6; S7; and S8) were subjected to an ECw of 3.5 dS m-1. Sour passion fruit growth was affected by variations in the level of electrical conductivity, regardless of the cationic nature of irrigation water. The use of salinized water with sodium favored the synthesis of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids of passion fruit plants at 180 days after transplanting.

2021,42,Physiological and agronomic characteristics of the common bean as affected by multifunctional microorganisms,"Multifunctional microorganisms (MMs) can have beneficial effects on plants through direct and indirect mechanisms. This study aimed to determine the effect of MMs on shoot and root biomass production; gas exchange; content of macronutrients in the shoots, roots and grains; yield components; and grain yield of common bean plants. A completely randomized design with twenty-six treatments and three replications was used under controlled conditions. Treatments consisted of the application of MMs and their combinations in pairs, with the nine rhizobacteria isolates BRM 32109, BRM 32110 and 1301 (Bacillus sp.), BRM 32111 and BRM 32112 (Pseudomonas sp.), BRM 32113 (Burkholderia sp.), BRM 32114 (Serratia sp.), 1381 (Azospirillum sp.) and Ab-V5 (Azospirillum brasilense); an edaphic fungal isolate T-26 (Trichoderma koningiopsis); and a control (without MMs). These MMs were applied at three time points: microbiolization of the seeds, watering the soil seven days after sowing (DAS) and spraying the plants with 21 DAS. In comparison to the control plants, the isolates 1301 and T-26, in addition to the combinations Ab-V5 + T-26, BRM 32114 + BRM 32110 and 1381 + T-26, provided better results, with an increase of 36.5% in the grain yield, a higher accumulation of biomass (78.0%) and a higher content of N, P and K (42.6, 67.8 and 25.7%, respectively) in the shoots of common bean plants. Therefore, the results allow us to infer that the use of MMs is a good strategy for increasing common bean grain yields.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40949/29019,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Agronomical and quality differences of four fig cultivars grown in Brazil,"Figs consumption date back to the beginnings of civilization. Currently, consumers have become more demanding about quality of fruits, and figs are then highly indicated, since it is rich in nutrients, making them a great addition to a healthy diet. Although there is only one commercial fig cultivar that is commonly grown in Brazil, different cultivars should be considered for the diversification of fig production with regards to their yield and fruit quality. This research aimed at evaluating growth, yield, physicochemical characteristics and bioactive compounds of figs grown in Brazil. Then, four cultivars (Roxo de Valinhos, White Genova, PI-189 and Troyano) were studied to determine canopy volume, productive efficiency, soluble solids - SS, pH, titratable acidity - TA, SS/TA ratio, sugars, ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, pigments and antioxidant activity. The cv. White Genova presented the highest canopy volume, while ‘Roxo de Valinhos’, ‘PI-189’ and ‘Troyano’ performed the greatest productive efficiency. The cvs. Roxo de Valinhos, White Genova and Troyano produced fruits with higher content of SS, reducing sugars and SS/TA ratio, while the fruits of ‘PI-189’ and ‘Roxo de Valinhos’ contained the highest levels of antioxidant activity.

Therefore, excessive amounts of pesticides are sprayed. In this study, a mobile robot was developed and tested on artificial weed targets for a micro-dose spraying system that works only with weed targets in order to reduce the use of spraying liquid in weed control. A prototype mobile robot consisted of a robotic platform, machine vision and steerable spraying unit was built and controlled by using LabVIEW, and tested to evaluate the feasibility of the spraying system. Greenness method and segmentation algorithm were utilized to extract artificial weed from the background. The artificial weed samples were treated according to their coordinates by the servo-based micro-dose spraying needle nozzle. The experiments were conducted at the speeds of 0.42, 0.54, 0.66, 0.78 and 0.90 km h-1 to evaluate the performance of the spraying system under laboratory conditions. The tracking and targeting performances of the mobile spraying system were observed visually. Consumption, the amount of deposition and coverage rate experiments were conducted by using graduated cups, filter papers and water-sensitive papers to evaluate the spraying efficiency of the system at 200 kPa spraying pressure. As a result, the targeted micro-dose spraying application saved about 95% application volume comparing with the broadcast spraying method. Higher spraying efficiency was determined at the middle locations than the edge locations according to the amount of deposition and coverage rate results.

2021,42,Culinary quality and sensory profile of cassava varieties harvested at different ages,"Sweet cassava must be rapidly cooked and meet the sensory and technological requirements of consumers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the culinary quality of sweet cassava varieties harvested at three ages and obtain the sensory profile of these varieties using the check-all-that-apply method (CATA). Roots of three cassava varieties released or recommended by Embrapa (BRS Aipim Brasil, BRS Dourada and Saracura) and the commercial variety Eucalipto, harvested at nine, 12 and 15 months of age, were evaluated for physical, chemical and sensory aspects. At nine months of age, the Saracura, BRS Aipim Brasil and BRS Dourada varieties did not differ in cooking time, averaging 41.62 min. The Eucalipto variety had similar cooking times at the three harvest ages, averaging 21.83 min. There was a difference between the four varieties at nine months, with Saracura exhibiting the lowest acceptance score (5.0) and differing from the Eucalipto variety, which showed an average score of 6.3. At 12 months of age, there was a significant increase in the acceptance of the Saracura and BRS Aipim Brasil varieties, which did not differ from Eucalipto and had an average score of 6.4. Consumers perceived differences between the sensory characteristics of the cassava varieties using CATA. The sensory terms “creamy”, “soft” and “sticky” can be associated with greater acceptance of cooked cassava roots, whereas terms such as “floury”, “slightly bitter”, “no taste”, “hard” and “fibrous” can be associated with less acceptance and are therefore undesirable from the consumer’s point of view. Principal component analysis showed that the age at which the roots were harvested had a great effect on the culinary quality of cassava, regardless of the evaluated variety. The commercial variety Eucalipto was well-accepted by the consumers irrespective of root age and can be harvested at any of the evaluated ages. For the Saracura, BRS Aipim Brasil and BRS Dourada varieties, harvesting is recommended at 12 or 15 months so that better quality roots are obtained.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41002/29027,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Hygienic-health quality and microbiological hazard of clandestine Minas Frescal cheese commercialized in north Tocantins, Brazil","Cheese is a popular product that integrates the diet of the majority of the population, almost on a daily basis. It is rich in nutrients and, therefore, also an excellent substrate for the multiplication of microorganisms, including pathogens. The microbiological contamination of these products is highly relevant to the industry, resulting in an economic loss, and to public health, due to the risk of causing foodborne diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hygienic-sanitary quality and the presence of bacterial pathogens in the clandestine Minas Frescal cheeses sold in the street open markets of Araguaína, TO, Brazil. Twenty-one samples were collected to evaluate the presence of total (TC) and thermotolerant (TTC) coliforms, Escherichia coli, and the pathotypes enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. The results showed that 100% of the cheese samples were in disagreement with the maximum standards of TC and TTC defined in the Brazilian legislation that regulates food quality control. In addition, 85.71% of the samples had values above the standard Brazilian maximum limit. In the study of diarrheagenic E. coli, 52.38%, 66.6%, and 4.76% of the samples were positive for EPEC, STEC, and EHEC, respectively, indicating fecal origin contamination of the samples and a potential consumer risk. No Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes were detected in these cheese samples. The high count of total and thermotolerant coliforms found in the samples demonstrates unsatisfactory sanitary conditions in the production, storage, and/or commercialization of this food product. The presence of EPEC, STEC, EHEC, and coagulase-positive staphylococci at high concentrations shows the health risk of the imminent consumption of Minas Frescal cheese.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41052/29028,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Although Escherichia coli is a commensal microorganism in the gastrointestinal tract, some pathotypes are known to cause high prevalence of diarrhea and food poisoning. The rapidly increasing resistance of bacteria to antimicrobials leads to the research in new, alternative treatment options. The present study aimed at the detection of E. coli pathotypes in newborn diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves, as well as susceptibility tests for antimicrobials and vegetal extracts. Samples were collected from animals located in dairy farms in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The samples were sent for microbiological isolation, genetic identification using PCR and antimicrobial tests. A total of 35 strains from diarrheic animals tested positive for at least one of the virulence genes analyzed: stx1, stx2, eae, bfp and sta. As for the non-diarrheic animals, 9 isolated strains possessed one of or both stx1 and stx2 genes, classifying these non-diarrheic cattle as reservoirs for the STEC pathotype and possible biological vectors of this pathogen.

2021,42,Testicular thermography and seminal quality in bucks submitted to intermittent scrotal insulation in tropical climate,"Testicular degeneration is highly prevalent in ruminants reared in a tropical climate in Brazil. It is therefore necessary to assess semen quality periodically in this animals. The objective of this work was to define standards images (thermograms) by using infrared thermography (TIV), associated with computerized seminal evaluation (CASA) to predict testicular alterations in a non-invasive way. For this, 10 goat males were selected, and testis insulated to evaluate the seminal quality and testicular superficial temperature recorded in four different moments: before, during and early and later after insulation. Semen collections and rectal temperatures (TR) and superficial testis (TS) by TIV were assessed for 60 days after insulation. Data were expressed in media and standard errors and analysis of variation (ANOVA) with comparison between the moments using Tukey test at 5% of probability. Changes in seminal quality followed the same standard of changes in TS, with no influence of the latter one on rectal temperature. The mean testicular temperature increased more than 2 degrees above the normal mean testis temperature, with significant increasing (p <0.05) in the moment during in relation to the moments before and post insulation, and concomitantly reduction in seminal parameters and almost normal return to 60 days post insulation. These changes in testis surface temperatures associated with semen analysis allowed to get patterns images of testicular degeneration, permitting to predict by TIV testis alterations for later assess of seminal quality.

2021,42,Resistance profile and virulence characterization of Escherichia coli isolated from diarrheic neonatal farm animals,"Neonatal diarrhea is the main cause of early mortality and morbidity in farm animals and the source of huge, direct and indirect, economic husbandry losses. Escherichia coli, a common harmless commensal bacterium, can turn into a main diarrheal pathogen through antibiotic resistance and the expression of genetically acquired virulence factors. In this study, fecal samples obtained from eight farms of animals with clinical signs characteristic of diarrhea were subjected to culture and bacterial isolation. Colonies suggestive of E. coli were identified through morphological and biochemical characteristics. Susceptibility tests to the main veterinary antibacterial agents were conducted using agar disk diffusion followed by phenotypical detection of extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL). A total of 301 colonies were characterized as E. coli and, out of the 192 that were tested, 134 showed resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobial drugs and were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR), and 14 were ESBL positive. Bacterial DNA was extracted for multiplex PCR (mPCR) using primers to detect ten different genes of diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC). Thirty-six bacterial strains were positive in the mPCR assay, 28 of which were classified as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and eight as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The high prevalence of MDR strains and the detection of ESBL denote the presence of resistance genes in animal husbandry; thus, it is important to isolate and characterize those pathogens and test antimicrobial sensitivity in vitro to avoid ineffective treatments and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, which are the major concerns of Public Health and One Health.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40548/29077,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Detection and semi-quantification of antibody to feline coronavirus in cats from the microregion of Ilhéus-Itabuna, Bahia, Brazil","Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an important virus that can be differentiated into two serotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECoV) and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV). Researchers have suggested that a mutation of FECoV to FIPV leads to the emergence of FIP, a disease with worldwide distribution and a high mortality rate. Furthermore, in December 2019, a human infectious disease, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is also caused by a coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged, and clarity regarding its relationship with FCoV remains lacking. Studies have shown that cats are susceptible to infection with this novel coronavirus (i.e., SARS-CoV-2). The aim of the present study was to detect and semi-quantify the presence of feline antibodies to FIPV in cats examined at the Veterinary Hospital of Santa Cruz State University, microregion of Ilhéus and Itabuna, Bahia, Brazil, between January and April 2018. Blood samples were collected from 68 domestic cats to perform complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical tests, and an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was used to detect FCoV infection. Of the 68 samples evaluated, seropositivity was observed in 4.4% (3/68) at titers of 1:20; only one sample remained seropositive at titers of 1:40 and 1:80. Two positive animals exhibited CBC and biochemical values within the normal range, while the other positive animals exhibited a mild decrease in platelet count (173,000 uL-1), mild lymphocytosis (7395 uL-1), and mildly increased alkaline phosphatase level (134 uL-1). Twelve months after the tests, none of the positive animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with FIP. Although the IFAT can facilitate diagnosis of FPIV, it cannot be used to differentiate antibodies for the FECoV and FIPV serotypes. Results of the present study demonstrated that FCoV was present in the population studied, and is an important risk factor for the development of FIP. In addition, the new COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of studies investigating FCoV because it was not possible to rule out, until now, the possibility of FCoV mutations in infected cats if it encounters SARS-CoV-2.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40707/29035,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Genetic diversity of Matrinxã breeding stocks: implications for management and conservation,"The formation of fish breeding stocks for fish farming or conservation programs is commonly carried out from the capture of fish in natural environments. Information on the geographic and genetic origin of these stocks is important to guide actions that allow correct management in captivity and, when lost, harm production and genetic conservation. In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and origin of two breeding stocks of matrinxã, Brycon amazonicus (INPA, Amazonas - INPA and Nova Motum, Mato Grosso - NM). A total of 68 caudal fin samples were collected, including 33 INPA samples and 35 NM samples. Twenty pairs of microsatellite primers were tested, but only seven primers showed satisfactory amplification, amplifying 41 alleles ranging from 187-318 bp. The polymorphic information content ranged from 0.135 (Borg25) to 0.782 (Bh6). Exclusive alleles were observed for both populations (INPA: 04 and NM: 18). Allelic richness results revealed that there was increased loss of genetic variation in NM, indicating a lower evolutionary potential of this stock. The average values of the observed heterozygosity corroborated this statement; however, there were high values for INPA (0.545) and NM (0.475), signifying an adequate genetic variability. An imbalance was found in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the Borg59 locus in INPA (P < 0.05), possibly due to the effect of null alleles, but was attributed to a founder effect. For NM, an imbalance in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed at loci BoM13 and Bh6, which together with the results of the mean inbreeding coefficient values demonstrated the presence of genetic drift. The analysis of molecular variance showed greater variation within populations than between them, and was confirmed by the genetic differentiation value (0.086 - moderate genetic differentiation) and by the distance and genetic identity values (0.273 and 0.761, respectively). Bayesian analysis designated a value of K = 2, with the presence of structuring for NM and INPA; however, with correlated allelic frequencies, confirming a common origin. This origin was corroborated by the presence of gene flow through the number of migrants (5.691). Based on these results, there was a moderate genetic variability for INPA and NM and their common origin was confirmed. Recommendations are also included to minimize the probability of inbreeding processes or genetic drift in the studied stocks.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39337/29036,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Yield, milk quality and physiological variables of dairy cows in rainy and dry seasons","The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of the dry and rainy seasons on the production, milk quality (lactose, fat, protein, total solids, TBC and SCC) and physiological (rectal and surface temperature and respiratory and heart rate) of crossbred cows (holstein/ zebu) in lactation, under rotational grazing regime in cultivated pasture, using 10 crossbred cows (holstein / zebu) in lactation, average live weight of 500 ± 30 kg, and in the rainy season they were between the fourth and fifth months of lactation and in the dry period were between the seventh and eighth months of lactation with an average initial production of 18 ± 4kg of milk / cow / day, maintaining batch homogeneity in both seasons. The animals were kept in a semi-intensive rearing system, using rotational grazing on pasture of Brachiaria decumbens, in an area of 3 hectares, where there was a conglomerate of trees that provided 5m² / animal with natural shade, to shelter the animals in the warm shorelines The seasons and times of the day significantly influenced (P < 0.05) the ambient temperature, relative air humidity and the black globe temperature index and humidity. The respiratory rate and surface temperature were higher (P < 0.05) in the dry season and the values for rectal temperature and respiratory rate were similar (P > 0.05) in the seasons. Milk production and protein showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) depending on the seasons. With the aid of physiological variables (rectal and surface temperature and heart and respiratory rate), even so, cows decreased their production and increased the concentration of protein in milk.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39583/29061,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Economic-financial analysis of the use of biscuit bran as an energy alternative in diets for confined lambs,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic and financial viability of replacing corn with biscuit bran (BB) in diets for Morada Nova lambs in feedlot. Twenty lambs confined with initial body weight of 17.00 ± 3.74 kg were used, arranged in four treatments, diet without biscuit bran (BB) and diets containing 15, 30 or 45% of biscuit bran in place of corn in the diet. Data, expenses and revenues of the activity were obtained during the period of January 2020 in the municipality of Sobral, Ceará. The economic and financial evaluation was carried out descriptively, using Excel® spreadsheets. In the scenarios evaluated, feeding, animal acquisition and labor costs were the items that most contributed to production costs. The highest food costs were observed in the system that used 15% of BB, representing about 32.86% of the total costs. The simulation for sheep production provided revenue higher than the production costs in all diets tested, resulting in positive economic indicators. On the other hand, although the system that uses diet without biscuit bran provides positive revenue, net income was the lowest (R$ 12,117.15 year-1). It was observed that all scenarios had a leveling point higher than 5,000 kg of meat year-1. The total productivity of the factors of all treatments evaluated was higher than 1, which indicates that the activity is stable, presenting high internal rates of return. Similarly, profitability rates are attractive, especially for diets containing BB, where the net present value is higher (R$ 362,143.26). Sensitivity analyses showed that even in the most unfavorable situations, such as a 30% reduction in production and market price, indicators are economically viable. The use of BB does not compromise the economic viability of the diet compared to the diet without BB, they present higher profitability, especially at the level of 15% in the diet.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40157/29370,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Use of babassu cake and pineapple byproduct silage in the diets of feedlot sheep,"This study evaluated the use of babassu cake as a replacement for soybean meal and pineapple byproduct silage as roughage in the diets of feedlot sheep. Ten rumen-fistulated sheep were used and distributed in an experimental design consisting of two 5 x 5 Latin squares. Babassu cake replaced soybean meal at four concentration levels (0, 26.66, 53.33, and 80%), and pineapple byproduct silage was used as roughage. A treatment was also evaluated in which elephant grass silage was used as roughage and corn and soybean meal were used as the concentrate. No effect of babassu cake as a replacement for soybean meal on dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber, or crude protein was observed. Higher babassu cake replacement levels in the diets resulted in linear reductions in the digestibility of the dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, organic matter, nonfiber carbohydrates and total carbohydrates. For the digestibility of the crude protein, no effect was observed after the addition of babassu cake. The replacement levels of the babassu cake had no effect on the intake and retention of the daily nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and ruminal pH. Babassu cake could replace soybean meal at concentrations of up to 80% when the roughage source was pineapple byproduct silage. Compared with elephant grass silage, pineapple byproduct silage improves nutrient intake and digestibility and nitrogen intake, retention, and absorption without compromising the ruminal pH or ammonia nitrogen of feedlot sheep.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40250/29040,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Body condition score at lambing and performance of Santa Inês ewes with an offspring during lactation,"The main objective of this research work was to evaluate the performance of Santa Inês ewes according to their body condition score (BCS) at lambing. Data from 135 adult ewes, with singletons, were used. Ewes were divided into three distinct groups: 1) Bellow average: BCS less than 2.5 points (n = 44); 2) Average: BCS between 2.5 and 3.0 (n = 53); and 3) Above average: BCS greater than 3.0 (n = 38). The scale for BCS varied from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very fat). The individual BW, BCS, metabolic profile, milk production and composition of ewes as well as their lambs’ performance until weaning were considered. Metabolic profile was monitored at -7, +7 and +60 days relative to lambing. It was observed that ewes with higher BCS were also heavier; however, there were no differences among the groups for weights of lambs at birth and weaning (70 days). As there was no difference in milk production and composition, the average daily weight gain of the lambs was also similar for the different BCS groups. The metabolic profile (glucose, ?-hydroxibutyrate, cholesterol, creatinine, urea, hemoglobin, albumin, total protein and aspartate aminotransferase - AST) was also similar among the groups. However, when the metabolic profile was compared among the different physiological stages relative to lambing, some differences were observed. For example, ?-hydroxibutyrate was greater during the peripartum period, and glucose was greater in the lactation phase. As conclusion we could say that even in a situation of poor BCS, Santa Inês ewes have the physiological capacity to adapt themselves to the negative energy balance like those of the periparturient period. It seems that irrespective of the BCS, ewes prioritized lactation and were able to produce enough milk to accordingly nurse their lambs",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40308/29041,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Are the effects of dietary lipid content in grazing beef cattle independent of the amount of concentrate supplement?,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of levels of concentrate supplement and dietary lipids on the nutritional characteristics, metabolic parameters, and performance of Nellore bulls grazing tropical pasture. Twenty-seven Nellore bulls were allotted to 2 × 2 completely randomized factorial design with two levels of supplementation and two levels of dietary lipids. The concentrate supplement was fed at 4 g kg-1 BW (low supplementation) and 8 g kg-1 BW (high supplementation), whereas the dietary lipid content was 28 g of ether extract (EE) g-1 on a dry matter basis (DM) (low-lipid diet) and 42 g EE kg-1 DM (high-lipid diet). There was no interaction between the level of concentrate supplement and dietary lipid content on all studied variables. High levels of supplementation led to shorter grazing time and reduced forage dry matter intake (DMF). On the other hand, the DM intake increased with increasing levels of concentrate supplement, with no significant effects on DM digestibility. The dietary lipid content did not affect forage and DM intakes. However, the digestibility of DM and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were lowest in high-lipid diets. Bulls receiving high levels of supplementation had higher average daily gains than low-supplemented animals. Neither the amount of concentrate supplement nor the dietary lipid content affected the hot carcass yield and carcass weight. Carcass fat deposition was greater in bulls fed high-lipid diets than in animals receiving low-lipid diets. The effects of the level of concentrate supplement and dietary lipid content on the nutritional characteristics and performance of grazing beef cattle are independent. Concentrate supplementation at 8 g kg-1 BW increases cattle performance but decreases forage utilization. Diets containing 42 g EE kg-1 DM reduces the digestibility of dry matter and fiber fractions, but increases backfat thickness.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40632/29042,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Yield and nutritive value of mechanically processed corn silage from an integrated crop-livestock system,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the yield and nutritional value of silage made from corn intercropped with marandu palisadegrass (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) in an integrated crop-livestock system. The corn was harvested at different maturity stages and cutting heights and was processed or not before ensiling. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications in a 2x2x2+1 factorial scheme. The treatments were composed of silage corn intercropped with marandu palisadegrass harvested at two cutting heights (20 or 45 cm) and two stages of maturity (1/4 of the kernel milk line or kernel physiological maturity) and subjected to two methods of processing (crushing or not crushing). A control treatment composed of conventionally grown corn silage was also included. The total dry matter yields of both crops did not differ significantly among treatments, demonstrating the viability of the intercropping system for both forage species. Although the dry matter content of the corn plants was higher at the time of ensiling, the fermentative and nutritive quality of the silages was not affected. Increasing the cutting height increased the grain content of the forage mass and also avoided harming the development of the intercropped grass. The silages from the physiological maturity treatment and from the processed treatment had the best quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40794/29044,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Production and quality of corn silage with forage and pigeon peas in a crop-livestock system,"The objective of this study was to evaluate maize in consortium with forage in a crop-livestock system for silage production, with subsequent formation of pasture. The experimental design comprised randomized blocks, with four replications, two types of corn cultivation, intercropped with two Brachiaria species (marandu grass and convert grass), and with and without intercropping with the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) BRS Mandarin. Dry matter productivity, the morphological composition of the corn, the botanical composition of the Brachiaria and pigeon peas, and the bromatological composition of the silage and Brachiaria were evaluated, as well as the losses caused by effluents. The consortia did not interfere with the productivity of corn for silage, and the silage from the consortium with pigeon peas exhibited a higher concentration of crude protein, demonstrating that the modality of the integrated agricultural production system of corn culture with Brachiaria and pigeon peas is an alternative to increase the protein content of the ensiled material and provide greater diversity of the remaining forage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40964/29045,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Economic feasibility of implementing an infrastructure for collecting rainwater from the roof of free-stall sheds,"This study aimed to analyze the economic feasibility of implementing and using the necessary infrastructure to collect rainwater from the roof of free-stall sheds in a dairy production system in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. Specifically, the total cost (TC), total operating cost (TOC), and actual operating cost (AOC) of a cubic meter of rainwater and the break-even point in cubic meters were estimated. The research was conducted from January to December 2017 on a property located in the south of Minas Gerais. The following MOP scenarios were analyzed: most likely (Scenario 1), optimistic (scenario 2), and pessimistic (scenario 3). The grant value of the Das Velhas River basin was considered for the most likely scenario, as it has the most similar value with that of the basin surrounding the Furnas reservoir, in which the property is inserted. The grant value for water collection and consumption from the Paraíba River basin was considered in Scenario 2, as this Federal basin has the lowest grant value. The grant value for water collection and consumption from the Piracicaba, Jundiaí, and Capivari river basins was considered in Scenario 3, as these basins have the highest prices for the cubic meter of the collected and consumed water. The implementation of the infrastructure for collecting rainwater from the roof of free-stall sheds under the studied conditions was economically unfeasible for all scenarios, with negative net present values (NPV). Simple and discounted paybacks were longer than the proposed horizon. The internal rate of return (IRR) could not be estimated due to the negative values of the net cash flow. The benefit-cost ratios (BCR) were unsatisfactory (lower than 1). The TC values for rainwater collection from the roof of free-stall sheds were R$ 23,206.59 and R$ 20,489.25 for scenarios with interest rates of 8.50 and 6.99%, respectively, while the TOC value was R$ 7,850.30 for all analyzed scenarios. The unit values for TOC and AOC were R$ 9.9024/m3 and R$ 1.3060/m3 of collected water, respectively. The break-even point could not be estimated in the studied scenarios, as the variable cost per cubic meter of water collected from the roof of the free-stall shed was higher than the grant value charged by the water management committees of the different studied basins.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/41068/29046,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Optimization of dietary lemon seed essential oil to enhance alfalfa silage chemical composition and in vitro degradability,"Purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of lemon-seed essential oils on chemical composition and in vitro degradability of alfalfa silage. Treatments were alfalfa silage with no additive (control) or treated with 60 ml/kg DM of lemon-seed (C60), of lemon-seed (C120) essential oils and equal mixed of them (M60). Whole plant alfalfa silage was ensiled for 60 d in triplicate laboratory scale tubes. Dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, insoluble fiber in acidic and neutral detergent, water soluble carbohydrate, pH, were measured with 3 replicates by in vitro gas production method. Dry matter (DM) content was greater for leo60 than control.  Compared with control, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration was decreased in leo120. Addition of essential oils and their combination to the silage significantly decreased (p<.0001) silage pH compared with untreated silage interestingly increased for all the silages containing essential oil compared with untreated silage. Addition of lemon-seed essential to alfalfa silage decreased the rate of disappearance of organic matter and dry matter in all treatments compared to the control treatment. The degradability potential of alfalfa silage has increased in treatments containing lemon-seed essential oil (60 ml / kg DM) which is significantly different from the control. In general, the obtained data show the positive effect of lemon-seed essential oil on the quality of alfalfa silage and its fermentation properties.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/42031/29064,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,"Bioavailability of soil Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn from soil fractions","Cationic micronutrients bioavailability depends on the chemical characteristics of soil fractions. Fourteen soils received individual doses of five micronutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, B) arranged in seven treatments set according a Baconian Matrix. The soils incubated with treatments during 15 days had corn cultivated in greenhouse for 30 days, in three consecutive growth cycles. The cationic micronutrients were determined in the corn shoots after each growth cycle. Soil samples collected before the first and after each growth cycle had the available concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn determined by single extractions (Mehlich-1 and DTPA-pH 7.3) and by sequential extraction. Correlation analysis was performed for the Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn concentrations determined in the corn shoots, the available concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in the soils (Mehlich-1 and DTPA) and the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in the soil fractions (sequential extraction). The distribution of available metals forms in fractions reflected their affinity with soil components. Soil available Cu correlated with Cu bound to organic matter. The exchangeable fraction was the main source of soil available Mn and Zn. The Fe availability related mainly to the Mn oxides, Fe oxides, and exchangeable fractions. The plants absorbed Cu mainly from the Mn-oxides and organic matter fractions. Manganese absorbed by plants originated from the exchangeable and Mn-oxides fractions. The Zn absorbed by plants originated mainly from the exchangeable fraction.

2021,42,"The no-tillage, with crop rotation or succession, can increase the degree of clay dispersion in the superficial layer of highly weathered soils after 24 years","Clay dispersion is directly related to water erosion, especially during detaching and dragging of particles. No-till is one of the most important strategies for soil and water conservation in tropical and sub-tropical regions, and when associated with crop rotation, may reduce the degree of clay dispersion. The study aimed to evaluate, after 24 years, the effect of different soil management systems and crop systems on the degree of clay dispersion of a Rhodic Ferralsol. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 4x2 factorial scheme, with four soil managements (continuous no-tillage, no-tillage with chiseling every three years, disk plowing followed by light harrowing and heavy disking followed by light harrowing) and with two crop systems (crop succession and rotation). The degree of clay dispersion was evaluated and associated with soil chemical attributes from layer 0.00-0.10 m. The degree of clay dispersion is affected by the soil management systems with no effect of crop systems. The soil management system with the lowest soil disturbance (continuous no-tillage) has a higher degree of clay dispersion than the ones that disturb the soil, regardless of the agricultural implement used or soil disturbance intensity. The soil electrochemical imbalance, primarily caused by soil potential acidity, is positively correlated to the increase in the degree of clay dispersion of the superficial soil layer under continuum no-tillage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39300/28586,E-ISSN 1679-0359

The number of nodes (NN) on the main stem was counted twice a week in each plant (replication), from emission of the first node until the end of the cycle. The linear regression (y = a + bx) of the number of nodes (NN, y) was adjusted for each plant based on the number of days after emergence (DAE, x). The rate of node appearance (RNA), in days node-1, was determined from the inverse of the slope of the linear regression between NN and DAE (RNA = 1/b). The RNA was calculated for the period of node emission (PNE, in days), i.e. from emergence to emission of the last node. The final number of nodes (FNN) was counted at the end of node emission. Variability was found in the rate of node appearance (RNA), the final number of nodes (FNN) and the period of node emission (PNE) between the cultivars and sowing dates. The rate of node appearance ranges between 2.20 and 8.23 days node-1, the final number of nodes between 2.20 and 17.20, and the period of node emission between 16.60 and 49.20 days. Plants of the IPR91-Baili and IPR92-Altar cultivars show better vegetative development (lower RNA, higher FNN and greater PNE) when sown in November, December, January and February, compared to those sown in October, March, April and May.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39778/28564,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Grazing heights, stocking rate, soil structure, and water infiltration in a crop-livestock integration","Grazing intensity on palisade grass as a function of grazing height in a crop-livestock integration (CLI) system alters the structural soil quality and water infiltration. This study aimed to verify the magnitude of the stocking rate and shoot and root dry matter of palisade grass at the end of the fifth cattle grazing period of an experiment in the CLI system on the visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS), soil-water infiltration rate, and basic infiltration rate (BIR) as a function of grazing heights on Urochloa brizantha cv. MG 5 Vitória in the northwestern Paraná State, Brazil. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with three replications and 1-ha experimental plots on an Oxisol. Four treatments with grazing heights of 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm were used in the CLI system, controlled with variable stocking rates of Purunã cattle in the autumn/winter season on Urochloa brizantha cv. MG 5 Vitória in succession to soybean in the summer. The maximum soil water infiltration was stabilized at 30 cm of grazing height of the palisade grass under continuous grazing in the CLI system. The increase in the stocking rate decreased the shoot dry matter of palisade grass, soil water infiltration, and structural soil quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40213/28498,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Gas exchange, growth, and quality of passion fruit seedlings cultivated with saline water","This study was conducted to evaluate the gas exchange, growth, and quality of passion fruit cultivars under irrigation with waters of different salinity levels. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, in Pombal-PB, Brazil, using a randomized block design in a 5 ? 2 factorial arrangement, with five levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water (0.3, 1.1, 1.9, 2.7, and 3.5 dS m-1) and two passion fruit cultivars (BRS Sol do Cerrado and Guinezinho), with three plants per plot and four replicates. The reduction in transpiration, intercellular CO2 concentration and CO2 assimilation rate in passion fruit plants grown with saline water was related to factors of stomatal and non-stomatal origin. Gas exchange and growth of passion fruit cultivars were negatively affected by water salinity from 0.3 dS m-1 at 75 days after sowing. Despite the reduction in the growth of the passion fruit cultivars, irrigation with water of up to 3.5 dS m-1 could be used to obtain seedlings with acceptable quality. Based on the relative yield of total dry phytomass, the passion fruit cultivars BRS Sol do Cerrado and Guinezinho were classified as moderately sensitive to water salinity during the seedling phase.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40413/28499,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Influence of dry and wet beef maturation on the microbiological quality and safety,"The most used methods for the maturation process are vacuum (wet-aged) and dry (dry-aged), which can influence the microbiological quality and safety of meat for consumption. In this study, we aimed to verify the differences in microbiological quality between beef (Longissimus dorsi) that was wet-aged and dry-aged for 30 days, by quantification of indicator microorganism groups and molecular identification of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. This study verified that the meat matured by the dry-aged method showed significantly lower counts of total coliforms, aerobic mesophiles, psychrotrophs, and molds and yeasts as compared to wet-aged meat. While the Salmonella spp. was not isolated in any beef sample, L. monocytogenes and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were isolated only from wet-aged beef. Thus, it was concluded that the superficial dehydration of the meat during dry-aged maturation, if carried out correctly and hygienically, confers higher microbiological quality and can reduce the occurrence of microbiological hazards.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40225/28500,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Effect of the application of probiotic strains of Enterococcus faecium on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of coalho cheese,"Coalho cheese is a typical Northeastern Brazilian food whose production and consumption has expanded considerably to other regions of the country. Despite its cultural and socioeconomic relevance, coalho cheese still has a negative reputation due to problems in its physicochemical and microbiological quality standards, especially when it is produced artisanally. For this reason, many researchers have been looking for alternatives to improve the quality and the notoriety of this product, such as the application of probiotic strains to inhibit pathogens. However, in addition to the research related to the desired probiotic properties and the safety of strains for food application, it is important to know the possible changes in the food matrix caused by this intervention. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the incorporation of probiotic strains of Enterococcus faecium on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of coalho cheese. The cheeses were made with pasteurized cow milk and probiotic strains of E. faecium were added during production. Cheeses were also made without adding the strains, and considered as control cheeses. The final products were evaluated for moisture, pH, titratable acidity, total carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, ash, color, organic acid profile, and sensory attributes. In addition, viable lactic acid bacteria were also assessed. Coalho cheeses containing E. faecium showed higher titratable acidity and lower pH. In addition, there was a reduction in the carbohydrate content, which was attributed to lactose degradation. The organic acid profile also varied, as highlighted by the increase in the concentration of lactic acid by a factor of 3.5, and by the absence of citric acid as a possible result of the metabolism of E. faecium in the production of aromatic compounds. There was no variation in the color or sensory acceptance of the cheeses. Therefore, the application of probiotic strains of E. faecium in coalho cheese production changes some physicochemical characteristics while maintaining essential properties, such as the color and sensory acceptability of the final product.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40421/28501,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Antibiotic resistance profile of gram-negative bacteria isolated from dog nasal swab samples, and antibacterial and antioxidant activities of aqueous extracts of Alpinia purpurta (Vieill.) K. Schum (Zingiberaceae)","The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and their negligent use among dog owners have contributed to the rise of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms found in pets. In addition, the search for medicinal plants with antibacterial properties has made the evaluation of aqueous extracts of Alpinia purpurata (Vieill.) K. Schum an important issue. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine the antibiotic resistance profile of gram-negative bacteria isolated from nasal swab samples of dogs and assess the antibacterial activity of the aqueous extracts of leaves and rhizomes of A. purpurata. The bacteria identified were tested using the agar disc diffusion assay for the evaluation of antibiotic resistance. A total of 16 isolates were obtained from the 19 samples collected, with a high prevalence of Escherichia coli (n=5). There was a high rate of resistance to ?-lactams, where the highest percentage was seen for amoxicillin (72.5%). Aqueous leaf extracts had high levels of total phenolic compounds (637.47 µg GAE mg-1), differing significantly (p < 0.05) from aqueous rhizome extracts (228.64 µg GAE mg-1). There was no significant difference in EC50 of DPPH values between the aqueous extracts; however, the antioxidant capacity of rhizome extracts had higher values than leaf extracts. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of leaves and rhizomes for the evaluated bacteria ranged from 9000 to 32,000 µg mL-1. For the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), most bacteria showed an MBC over 38,400 µg mL-1 for the rhizome. In conclusion, the bacteria isolated from dog nasal swabs showed a high resistance profile for the antibiotics of the penicillin class. Additionally, the results from the analysis of the aqueous extracts of rhizomes and leaves of A. purpurata showed an antimicrobial effect possibly associated with a high content of total phenolic compounds; these results can create a scope for using these extracts together with conventional antibiotics to control the emergence of antibiotic resistance among microbial species.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39504/28502,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Prostaglandin F2? as ovulatory stimulus in dairy cows and buffaloes raised in the Amazon biome,"This study evaluated the effect of a prostaglandin F2? (PGF) analogue as an ovulatory stimulus in dairy cows and buffaloes raised in the Amazon biome. To this end, three experiments were performed in the state of Rondônia, located in the Amazon biome. In Experiment 1, 22 lactating dairy buffaloes received 2 mg of intramuscular (I.M.) estradiol benzoate (EB) on day 0 and an intravaginal progesterone-releasing device (CIDR) from day 0 to day 9 of the protocol. On days 8 and 9, all cows were given 500 ?g of I.M. d-cloprostenol (PGF analogue). On day 10, buffaloes were divided into two groups to receive 500 ?g of PGF (PGF group, n = 8) or no treatment (CTL group, n = 14), respectively. In Experiment 2, 16 lactating crossbred dairy cows (Holstein x Gir) received 2 mg of EB on day 0 and a CIDR insert from day 0 to day 8. On days 7 and 8, all cows were given 500 ?g of d-cloprostenol. On day 9, cows were divided into two groups to receive 500 ?g of d-cloprostenol (PGF group, n = 8) or no treatment (CTL group, n = 8), respectively. In Experiment 3, 16 lactating crossbred dairy cows (Holstein x Gir) were handled and treated similarly as in Experiment 2, although cows did not receive d-cloprostenol on day 8. Single-point outcome variables were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), while proportions with dichotomous outcomes were analyzed with the chi-square test. In Experiment 1, there was no difference (P = 0.30) in the ovulation rate between groups, and, on average, 68% of the buffaloes ovulated. Moreover, the treatment did not affect the interval to ovulation (P = 0.61) nor the diameter of the preovulatory follicle (P = 0.47). As for Experiment 2, only one cow, from the PG group, did not ovulate. There were no differences between the CTL and PG groups (P = 0.69) in the moment of ovulation, which occurred in average 82 h after CIDR removal. Finally, in Experiment 3, cows treated with PGF ovulated earlier than those in the CTL group (62.5 ± 5.8 and 94.5 ± 13.5 h, respectively; P = 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PGF hastens ovulation in lactating dairy cows, whereas no effect was observed in dairy buffaloes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39633/28503,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Hematologic response and serum and peritoneal fluid proteinogram of cattle affected by intestinal diseases and traumatic reticuloperitonitis,"This study aimed to evaluate the hematologic response and the serum and peritoneal fluid (PF) proteinogram of cattle affected by digestive diseases. Twenty-seven animals were distributed in two groups: GI (intestinal diseases) and GII (traumatic reticuloperitonitis, TRP). The animals were previously submitted to a physical exam. Subsequently, blood samples were collected to perform the complete blood count, determine the plasma protein and fibrinogen, and obtain the serum for proteinogram in polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). Simultaneously, PF was collected to perform physical and chemical evaluation and the electrophoretic profile (SDS-PAGE). ANOVA at the 5% probability level was used to compare the groups. The animals showed signs of apathy, dehydration, and gastrointestinal hypomotility in both groups. However, GI animals showed more significant clinical changes. The blood count of both groups (P > 0.05) showed leukocytosis due to neutrophilia and a regenerative left shift with hyperfibrinogenemia. The proteinogram of both body fluids allowed the identification of proteins albumin (ALB), transferrin (TRF), ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, ?1-acid glycoprotein (?1-AGP), MW 23000 Da, ?1-antitrypsin, IgA, and IgG. The [PT] PF/[PT] blood serum ratio of each of the identified proteins increased, showing statistical differences between groups (P < 0.05) regarding PT, ALB, TRF, ?1-AGP, and IgG values, with GI animals showing the highest ratio. Intestinal diseases and TRP triggered a systemic and local response characterized by clinical, hematological, and serum and PF proteinogram alterations. The proteins ?1-GPA, haptoglobin, and TRF measured in PF were good inflammation biomarkers and useful as an auxiliary tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of digestive diseases in cattle.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39887/28505,E-ISSN 1679-0359

2021,42,Cardiorespiratory and hemogasometric effects of epidural ketamine and its associations with morphine and xylazine in sheep,"This study aimed to evaluate the cardiorespiratory and hemogasometric effects of epidural ketamine and its associations with morphine and xylazine in ewes submitted to transcervical cervix transposition with a hegar dilator. Ten Santa Inês breed ewes were studied in a cross over model study where three epidural protocols (GK = ketamine 2.0 mg kg-1; GKM = ketamine 2.0 mg kg-1 + morphine 0.1 mg kg-1; GKX = ketamine 2.0 mg kg-1 + xylazine 0.05 mg kg-1) were compared among each other and with a control treatment (GS= saline 1 mL/7.5 kg). The assessed variables were heart rate, respiratory frequency, ear temperature, non-invasive blood pressure and hemogasometric analysis. All parameters were assessed at baseline and then ewes were sedated with an association of acepromazine (0.1 mg kg -1) and diazepam (0.2 mg kg -1). Ten minutes after sedation all parameters were reassessed and afterwards the epidural injections were performed. Hemogasometry was repeated at 15 and 30 minutes after epidural and the other parameters assessed at 05, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after epidural. GKX showed a slight respiratory depression with lower levels of PO2 and a compensatory increase in respiratory frequency. GKM presented the lower temperature mean. All protocols showed few cardiorespiratory effects when compared with control. Epidural with 2.0 mg kg-1 ketamine isolated was considered the best option for short procedures as obstetric manipulations in sheep due to its cardiorespiratory stability when compared with the protocols using associations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40117/28507,E-ISSN 1679-0359

Five Boer males underwent semen collection, totaling 10 viable collections per animal. After evaluation, the ejaculates were pooled and fractionated in Tris-yolk medium with the addition of 0; 30; 45; or 60ng mL-1 of DHA and 0.4 mmol of alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E). The semen was cryopreserved in a freezing machine (TK 3000TM) and placed in a cryogenic cylinder for subsequent analysis. Data were evaluated by regression analysis at 5% significance. There were no differences (P > 0.05) in sperm kinetic parameters evaluated by computer assisted sperm analysis: total motility (79.17 ± 17.31%), progressive motility (14.04 ± 5.73%), curvilinear speed (58.82 ± 6.35µm/s), progressive linear speed (22.49 ± 3.63µm/s), mean path speed (35.17 ± 4.52µm/s), linearity (38.69 ± 5.79%), rectilinearity (63.99 ± 6.64%), and oscillation index (59.68 ± 2.99%).

2021,42,Antimicrobial effect of bothropstoxin-i in broilers,"Bacterial resistance is a sanitary issue explained by indiscriminate use of nonprescription drugs, and antimicrobial use in food production for growth promotion. Bothropstoxin-I (BthTx-I) is a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from Bothrops jararacussu venom, which has a known antimicrobial effect. The goal of this study was the unprecedented evaluation of in vivo antimicrobial activity of BthTx-I in broilers. Microbiological, biochemical, and histological parameters were determined using 84 21-day old broilers that were kept in cages with four birds each at a density of 625 cm2/broiler. The experiment was randomized by three treatments with seven repetitions of four broilers each that lasted seven days. The treatments were: 1) bacitracin zinc diet; 2) PLA2-BthTx-I; 3) without additives. The data obtained from the studied variables was subjected to analysis of variance and an F-test at the 5% significance level. Averages of each variable in each treatment were compared by Tukey’s test. Broiler bacterial cloacal counts showed that BthTx-I decreased the microbial population without reducing body weight, intestinal morphology, or liver or kidney histopathological damage. The toxin showed in vivo activity, being an alternative for better performance in the production of broiler chickens, because it acted by decreasing the microbial load of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of the birds and did not cause muscle, liver or kidney damage at the assessed dosage.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40248/28509,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Effect of advancing maturity stages of corn for silage on chemical characterization, digestibility and production costs","The goal of the present study was to evaluate the biomass and grain yield, the morphological and chemical composition, production costs and the ruminal disappearance of the whole corn plant and grain-free corn plant harvested at different reproductive stages. The experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of six treatments, where each treatment corresponded to a stage of corn maturity. The advance of plant cycle promoted an increase in dry biomass and grain yields per unit area, reducing production costs. Higher participation of grains and lower participation of structural components promoted a reduction in NDF and ADF, with the lowest values in dough grain (R4) and dent grain (R5) stages. The advancement of stages promoted an increase in production and a reduction in costs, but significantly reduced the quality of grain-free plants, increasing the NDF, ADF and ADL; but R4 and R5 presented NDFd of 84.80 % and 82.79 %, respectively, showing to be a good quality fiber. R4 stage had the highest rumen disappearance values after 24 and 48 hours of incubation. Based on chemical data, ruminal disappearance, ruminal degradation kinetics of the whole corn plant and without grains, the R4 stage of the evaluated hybrid is the stage at which the plant had the best quality, representing the appropriate stage to harvest the material for making silage, aiming at the production of a silage with good chemical quality.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39554/28510,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Morphophysiology of tropical grasses under different water supply in two growing seasons: II. BRS Massai and BRS Tamani grasses,"This study aimed to evaluate the physiological parameters and the biomass flow and structural characteristics of BRS Massai and BRS Tamani grasses under different irrigation conditions. The rating of gas exchange, biomass flow and structural characteristics were performed in dry periods and dry/rainy season, under the water supply of 30; 60; 90 and 120% of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement 4x2 (water supply and grass). The experiment was conducted in pots with capacity for 7.5 dm³, using as substrate layer of 0-0.2 m soil. There was no effect (P < 0.05) between the gas exchange in the dry period, having the largest growing parameters of irrigation schemes. In the transition period of dry/rainy, we observed a reversal behavior in relation to the dry period, showing a rapid recovery of grasses under the minor water supply. It was observed quadratic behavior to concentrations of CO2 in the leaf mesophilic (Ci) with maximum point to the BRS Massai grass and minimum point to the BRS Tamani grass, where the major and minor Ci were 119 and 48 ppm in the water supply of 107 and 35% of ETo, respectively. In relation to the biomass flow, the BRS Tamani grass presented greater stem elongation rate and leaf senescence rate in relation to BRS Massai in both periods assessed. In the dry period, we observed a higher biomass production of green leaf blades in the BRS Tamani grass, while in the transition dry/rainy season, the results for this variable were similar, and at the same time that observed higher accumulation of green culm biomass to the BRS Tamani grass, which certainly affected its structure. It is concluded that the application of a minimum daily water supply of 30% of ETo allows the maintenance of BRS Massai and BRS Tamani grasses without incurring the death of tillers and reduction of regrowth vigor, whereas the water supply of 90% of ETo favors the morphophysiological characteristics, especially of BRS Tamani grass.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39800/28512,E-ISSN 1679-0359

At day 14, six suckling piglets per sow were distributed into three treatments and allotted in a randomized block design, with eight replicates and two piglets per experimental unit. Treatments consisted of a Control - oral supplementation with L-alanine (1.70 g), D-glucose (1.74 g) and distilled water (3.44 mL); Trp - oral supplementation with Trp (3.5 g/d) and distilled water; and Trp + Pyr - oral supplementation with Trp (3.5 g/d) + Pyr (0.0095 g/d) and distilled water. Each treatment was supplied orally five times per day (2.5 mL each treatment), from 14 to 21 days old. Piglets were monitored continuously in the nursing phase for 24 h at 21, 28 and 33 days of age to assess the behavior (standing, lying, eating, socializing, sitting and drinking). Piglets receiving oral Trp + Pyr showed a decreased weight loss on the first day after weaning (P = 0.03). Performance was not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments in each studied period, such as in overall period (21 to 34 days) after weaning. Piglets receiving Trp supplementation visited the feeders more frequently from days 21 to 22 (P < 0.01) and from days 28 to 29 (P < 0.02), as well as in the overall period (P < 0.01). It is concluded that high doses of tryptophan with or without high doses of pyridoxine, supplied orally to nursing piglets, reduced the weight loss on the first day after weaning and increased the frequency of visits to the drinkers on the first day after weaning and also to the feeders, mainly from weaning until 7 days after.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39989/28514,E-ISSN 1679-0359

On this basis, productive and chemical traits were evaluated in marandu grass, in a simulation of the drift effect, using sublethal doses of the herbicide glyphosate. The experiment was in laid out in a randomized-block design with split plots in time, in four replicates. The effect of sublethal doses of glyphosate acid equivalent (a.e.) (21.60, 43.20, 64.80, 86.40 and 108.00 g ha-1) and control was evaluated in the plots; and the effect of harvesting at 92, 113, 134 and 155 days after sowing (DAS) the grass was evaluated in the subplots. The Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu was collected at a height of 0.20 m, at a defoliation interval of 21 days, to estimate production and chemical traits, in experimental plots with a usable area of 7.5 m2. Leaf: stem ratio was influenced by the interaction between the evaluated factors (dose and harvest). Dose fitted a second-order polynomial model, with a hormesis effect of 21.60 to 76.50 g ha-1 of glyphosate a.e. Harvesting at 134 DAS differed significantly from 92 DAS. The forage yield showed a linear response inversely proportional to the increasing glyphosate doses. There was a polynomial increase in leaf phosphorus content, characterizing hormesis up to the sublethal dose of 72.50 g a.e. ha-1.

In specific terms, the total production cost (TC), total operating cost (TOC) and effective operating cost (EOC) of a cubic meter of recycled sand were estimated in order to estimate the total sand consumption for the free-stall system and per bed year-1 as well as the equilibrium point of the amount of recycled sand, in cubic meters. The experiment was carried out on a farm located in the south of Minas Gerais from January 2016 to December 2017. Three scenarios were analyzed by the tree-point estimation method (MOP - most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic). Utilization of 85%, 95% and 75% of the recycled sand was considered for scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In all of them, the value charged per cubic meter of sand by a supplier close to the farm was considered. Monte Carlo simulation was also carried out with hurdle rates (HR) of up to 90%. Under the studied conditions, sand recycling showed to be economically viable in all scenarios, with positive net present values (NPV), internal rates of return above the HR, simple and discounted payback below the 10-year horizon, and satisfactory cost benefit-1 ratios (greater than 1). The EOC of one cubic meter of recycled sand was estimated at R$5.04, R$4.51 and R$5.72 for scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively, whereas the average TC, considering all scenarios, was R$6.84 (+0.81), which is less than the acquisition price of R$28.57 at the sand extraction site. The TC was R$37,219.51 and R$34,637.74 for the scenarios with HR of 8.50 and 6.99%, respectively, whereas TOC was R$22,572.08 in all analyzed scenarios. The estimated total annual sand consumption by the free-stall system was 526.44 m³, with an estimated average of 1.23 m³ (+0.28) bed-1 year-1. All Monte Carlo simulation models showed positive NPV as well as HR of up to 90%, which reflect a high probability of positive NPV.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40433/28516,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Economic viability of a canadian biodigester for power generation in dairy farming,"This study aimed to analyze the economic viability of implementing and using a Canadian biodigester for power generation in a milk production system. Specifically, we intended to estimate the generated power production, the total production cost (TC), the total operating cost (TOC), and the effective operating cost (EOC) of 1 kW of power generated, and estimate the break-even point of the power produced. The research was carried out on a farm located in southern Minas Gerais (Brazil) from January to December 2017. Three scenarios were analyzed through the tree-point estimation (most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic). Scenario 1 considered the use of power for the acclimatization of free-stall barns during 13 hours day-1 plus the use of 50% of the produced biofertilizer. Scenario 2 considered the use of power during 13 hours day-1 for the acclimatization of free-stall barns and milking parlor, which means an increase in power consumption estimated at 10% compared to scenario 1, plus the use of 75% of the produced biofertilizer. Moreover, scenario 3 considered the use of power for the acclimatization of free-stall barns during 6.5 hours day-1 plus 25% of the produced biofertilizer. All scenarios considered the amount charged per kWh by the Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (CEMIG). Monte Carlo simulations were carried out with minimum acceptable rates of return ranging from zero to 50%. Power generation was economically viable in all scenarios, with positive net present value (NPV), internal rates of return above the minimum acceptable rate of return, simple and discounted payback below the 10-year horizon, and satisfactory benefit-cost ratios. The EOC values of 1 kWh of power were estimated at R$ 0.1990, R$ 0.1791, and R$ 0.3308 for scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively, whereas the mean total cost (TC) was R$ 0.5618 (±0.21) considering all scenarios, above the purchase values at CEMIG, which would be R$ 0.50. The TC value was R$ 99,804.42 for scenarios 1 and 2, and R$ 92,424.09 for scenario 3, with a minimum acceptable rate of return of 8.50, while the TOC values were R$ 69,486.62 in scenarios 1 and 2, and R$ 62,229.66 in scenario 3. The amount of power generated in all scenarios was higher than the break-even point. All Monte Carlo simulation models showed positive NPV values, indicating that there is a high probability of being above expectations.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40592/28517,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,"Effect of 11CFT and 11C33 inoculants on the chemical and fermentation composition, and aerobic stability of corn silage during the feed out period","The objective was to evaluate the efficiency of two bacterial inoculants, 11CFT and 11C33, with different genera of lactic acid bacteria on the chemical and fermentation composition of the silage, and the temperature and pH behavior of the silage during the feed out period. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, with three treatments: corn silage without inoculant (control); corn silage with 11CFT inoculant (consisting of strains of Lactobacillus buchneri and L. casei); and corn silage with 11C33 inoculant (consisting of strains of L. buchneri, L. plantarum and Enterococcus faecium). The use of both inoculants increased the concentration of lactic acid in the silage (22.42 g kg-1 for control against 36.00 and 33.33 g kg-1 for 11CFT and 11C33, respectively) and reduced aerobic dry matter losses. The silage treated with 11C33 obtained a higher concentration of acetic acid (17.44 g kg-1) and propionic acid (2.08 g kg-1). The 11CFT inoculant provided a lower concentration of ethanol, however, without differing from the silage with 11C33 (0.70 and 1.61 g kg-1, respectively). Even without variations in temperature and pH at silage unloading, the use of the 11C33 inoculant generated a higher concentration of acetic and propionic acid, providing better aerobic stability days after unloading. Both inoculants also improved the in situ ruminal digestibility of corn silage compared to control silage. They provide an increase in the content of lactic and propionic acids, which assist to reduce dry matter losses and ethanol production. There were no variations in temperature and pH at the silo unloading, however, the use of the 11C33 inoculant generated a higher concentration of acetic and propionic acids providing better aerobic stability after exposure to air.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40645/28518,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Physiological potential of corn seeds treated with different dosages of molybdenum and potassium,"Corn is important in agriculture for its dual is uses as food and animal feed. The use of quality seeds is fundamental for outcomes in the field. The treatment of seeds with molybdenum may increase the productive capacity and uniformity of the corn. For this to work, the amount applied to the seeds must be adequate to promote development and increase the final crop production. Thus, the objective of this work was to verify the effects of molybdenum and potassium application on the germination and vigor of corn seeds. The physiological quality of the seeds was evaluated by germination, first count, seedling length (shoot and root), seedling dry matter mass, emergence, and the cold test. Six treatments (T1–T6) were performed, with T1 free of molybdenum and potassium and the others with varying dosages. The seeds were treated with a commercial product that containing molybdenum and potassium. The design was completely randomized, with four replications and six treatments. Smaller doses of molybdenum resulted in a higher percentage of normal seedlings. Based on the length and dry mass of the seedlings, it was verified that maize seeds were negatively impacted by increasing doses of molybdenum and potassium. In the emergence tests in sand, treatments T5 and T6 presented a greater number of seedlings. The physiological quality of corn seeds was not significantly influenced by the application of molybdenum and potassium in the first count and germination results in the cold and germination tests.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/37390/28519,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Enzymatic activity in azuki bean seedlings subjected to salinity and water deficiency,"Salinity and water deficiency are factors that limit the initial development of crops, directly interfering with the efficiency of food production. Studies on the behavior of cultivable species under stress are important to determine management actions; therefore, the mechanisms involved in post-stress recovery should be investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of water and salt stress on enzymatic activity in azuki bean seedlings. The experimental design was a completely randomized, 4 × 6 factorial arrangement (four reagents: CaCl2, KCl, NaCl, and polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) × six osmotic potentials: 0.0, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 MPa). The quantification of protein content and analysis of enzyme (catalase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) activity in seedlings were performed on the 10th day after sowing. NaCl is toxic and recovery of azuki bean seedlings was less likely under salt stress owing to reduced enzymatic activity. In contrast, seedlings subjected to KCl treatment showed increased production of antioxidant enzymes.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/38048/28520,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Upland rice seedling performance promoted by multifunctional microorganisms,"Multifunctional microorganisms can contribute to the development of plant root systems and positively affect the grain yield of crops. However, studies of the use of these microorganisms to benefit root development in rice plants are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of rhizobacterial inoculation of the seeds on the root development of upland rice seedlings. The experiment was carried out in the agricultural microbiology laboratory of Embrapa Rice and Beans, and we adopted a completely randomized design with eight replications. The treatments consisted of the inoculation of rice seeds with the rhizobacteria 1. Pseudomonas fluorescens (BRM 32111), 2. Burkholderia pyrrocinia (BRM 32113), 3. Serratia sp. (BRM 32114), 4. Bacillus sp. (1301), 5. Azospirillum brasilense (Ab-V5), 6. Azospirillum sp. (1381), and a 7. control treatment (without microorganisms). Treatment using the microorganism Azospirillum sp. (1381) provided the longest roots, greatest root volume and highest total dry mass of roots, at 86.34, 111.53 and 29.41%, respectively, significantly superior to the control treatment. In addition, treatments Ab-V5 and Bacillus sp. (1301) resulted in a root diameter of 13.81 and 13.06%, respectively, larger than that of the control treatment. The use of these multifunctional microorganisms was efficient for promoting the root development of rice seedlings.",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/39759/28522,E-ISSN 1679-0359
2021,42,Detection of mycobacteria in coalho cheese sold in Northeastern Brazil,"The aim of the present study was to detect and identify Mycobaterium spp. in 50 samples of coalho cheese sold in the Northeast region of Brazil. Of the 50 analyzed samples, 35 were produced by the artisanal process, using raw milk, and 15 originated from industrialized establishments that pasteurize milk. Conventional and real-time nested PCR for the rv2807 gene of the M. tuberculosis complex was performed directly from the 50 analyzed samples. Samples of coalho cheese were grown simultaneously in Stonebrink medium, and conventional PCR was performed from the bacterial isolates with primers that flank differentiation region 4 (DR4), specific to M. bovis, mb400F. Bacterial isolates negative by PCR for RD4 were subjected to PCR for hsp65 of Mycobacterium spp., with subsequent DNA sequencing. The cultures were negative for the M. tuberculosis complex, but two samples (4%) from the artisanal process (with raw milk) exhibited identity with hsp65 of Mycobacterium lehmanii (Sequence ID: KY933786.1, identities: 312/363 [86%]); and Mycobacterium rutilum (sequence ID: LT629971.1, identities: 331/371 [89%]), showing to be indicative environmental contamination. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are emergent and ubiquitous microorganisms; therefore, they deserve greater attention in the cheese production chain, both in terms of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and food Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).",https://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/semagrarias/article/view/40459/28523,E-ISSN 1679-0359
